The game is comprised of twenty levels across seven worlds. Features include a new protagonist, new monkeys, new gadgets, and new mini games.</p><p>The goal of the game is to capture three hundred monkeys that are out wreaking havoc on the world, with the ultimate goal being to stop their leader, the super-intelligent evil white monkey known as <a href=\"/specter/3005-3868/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3868\">Specter</a>, from using them to take over the world.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>It's been a few years since the events of Ape Escape and everything has returned to normal. There are no more manic mischievous monkeys maladroitly meandering across the mainland, and humans have kept their status as the world's dominate species. All is well.</p><p>The Professor decides to take a vacation and leave Jimmy, <a href=\"/spike/3005-2135/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2135\">Spike</a>'s cousin, in charge of his lab while he's away. Jimmy is given the simple assignment of sending a shipment of specially designed monkey pants to Monkey Park via the lab's transporter. Distracted by a TV show, Jimmy overloads the transporter and inadvertently sends every citizen in Monkey Park a new Peak Point Helmet along with their new pair of pants.</p><p>Specter, seizing the opportunity, once again commands the recently helmeted monkeys to aid him in his attempt at taking over the world. It's now up to Jimmy to capture the monkeys, stop Specter, and save the world before The Professor returns.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>Ape Escape 2's controls are almost exactly like those found in the first game. All character movement is controlled using the left analog stick, while the right stick is used to attack with the selected gadget in whatever direction the player pushes it. This gives the player the ability to attack anywhere around the character.</p><p>With some gadgets (such as the Stun Club and the Dash Hoop) the player must instead spin the right analog stick in rapid circles, resulting in a 360 degree attack or a charging up of the gadget.</p><p>The face buttons are used to switch between gadgets, and the shoulder buttons are used for jumping and camera control<i>.</i></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Ape Escape 2 is essentially the same as that found in original. Because of this, some of the content found in the gadgets section is borrowed from the original <a href=\"/ape-escape/3030-13371/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13371\">Ape Escape</a> page.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>Gadgets are the most important part of gameplay, allowing Jimmy to capture and attack monkeys, while also helping him to navigate the environment. Jimmy will have access to a total of twelve gadgets - nine returning gadgets from the original Ape Escape and three new ones (denoted by an *).</p><ul><li><b>Electro Magnet*</b> - A gadget that is used to manipulate certain magnetic objects found throughout the game. Use the right analog stick to select the object, and the left stick to move it.</li><li><b>Bananarang*</b> - A throwing gadget used to lure hungry monkeys with the scent of bananas towards wherever it lands. Swing the right analog stick to throw the bananarang.</li><li><b>Water Cannon*</b> - Sprays water to put out fires obstructing progress through the level. Can also be used to stun monkeys. Sprays in whatever direction the right stick is pressed.</li><li><b>Stun Club -</b> A lightsaber-like gadget that stuns monkeys, and also harms various other enemies. Swing the right analog stick to swing the club.</li><li><b>Monkey Net -</b> The only gadget that can capture monkeys (on land). Swing the right analog stick to swing the net.</li><li><b>Aqua Net -</b> The only gadget that can be used underwater. It is automatically switched to when Jimmy is in water, and can shoot out nets to capture monkeys.</li><li><b>Monkey Radar -</b> A radar that is used to find monkeys. The closer Jimmy is to a monkey, the faster and higher-pitched the sound it emits will be. Once close enough, the camera can zoom in on the monkey and display a little bio. Rotating the right analog stick rotates the radar dish.</li><li><b>Catapult -</b> A slingshot that stuns monkeys. Can also harm enemies and hit buttons. Can shoot 3 different types of pellets: Normal, Guided, or Explosive. Pull back on the right analog stick to aim, and let go to shoot.</li><li><b>Sky Flyer -</b> A little handheld propeller that allows Jimmy to rise up in the air. Spin the right analog stick to spin the Sky Flyer, and give Jimmy lift. Continuous spinning will not keep Jimmy airborne, but it will slow his descent.</li><li><b>R.C. Car -</b> A remote controlled car that can fit through small holes. Used to hit unreachable buttons, or to draw monkeys out of hiding. The right analog stick controls the car.</li><li><b>Power Punch -</b> Obtainable after defeating Specter for the first time. An extendable device with what appears to be a boxing glove at the end, it is a powerful Gadget that can destroy boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot. Tilt the right analog stick slightly for a weak punch, all the way for a strong one.</li><li><b>Dash Hoop</b> - A hula hoop that gives Jimmy a speed boost, also allowing him to bowl over enemies. Spin the right analog stick to spin and charge the hoop. Once charged, let go of the stick to activate the boost.</li></ul><h3>Monkeys</h3><p>All of the three hundred monkeys found in Ape Escape 2 are unique. They all have their own names, stats (alertness, aggression, speed, and stomach fullness), personality traits (e.g. cheeky, easygoing, flashy), and fighting styles.</p><p>Capturing all three hundred of them is not required though, as each level has a quota that must be met in order to proceed that is usually less than the total number of monkeys found in that level.</p><p>There are light stealth elements to the gameplay. It is easier to catch monkeys that have not detected Jimmy's presence. Each monkey's situational awareness level is represented by the color of the light on top of their helmet. Blue means the monkey is in a state of calm and is unaware anything is a miss. Yellow signifies that it is in caution mode, it suspects something is up and will become more aware of its surroundings. Red means that the monkey knows Jimmy is there, and will try to flee or fight back.</p><h3>The Freaky Monkey Five</h3><p>In addition to the three hundred regular monkeys, there's a group of five boss monkeys known as the Freaky Monkey Five. They were given Vita-Z bananas by Specter, turning them into stronger, tougher, more intelligent foes.</p><ul><li><b>Blue Monkey</b> - The first of the Freaky Monkey Five Jimmy comes across. He is mostly unremarkable compared to his other four counterparts, his only outstanding qualities being his enhanced speed and intelligence. He zips around on a unicycle, forcing Jimmy to use the Dash Hoop to keep up with him.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Yellow Monkey</b> - Yellow Monkey has a thing for the Vita-Z bananas, and after eating way more than he was supposed to grows to the size of a small sky scraper. Though he is very large, he is also very nimble, and the only way for Jimmy to defeat him is to wait for a rush attack then hit him with the Stun Club.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pink Monkey</b> - She fancies herself a pop singer. When Jimmy first meets her she believes him to be an adoring fan and starts singing to him. However when Jimmy tries to capture her she freaks out and becomes Dark Pink Monkey, giving her many attacks such as laser beams, force fields, and flames.</li></ul><ul><li><b>White Monkey</b> - The most intelligent of the Freaky Monkey Five, White Monkey fights Jimmy with brains rather than brawn. He fights Jimmy be creating and controlling a robot version of him called Mecha Jimmy he built using data he obtained about the real Jimmy. Luckily, Mecha Jimmy has a major weak point that White Monkey failed to foresee.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Red Monkey</b> - The final member of the Freaky Monkey Five Jimmy faces, Red Monkey is also the strongest monkey in the game. He kidnaps Jimmy's tiny monkey companion who is eventually taken to Specter's moonbase. He uses a wide range of physical attacks, from martial arts and boxing, to stunning Jimmy with flatulence.</li></ul><h2>Levels</h2><p>Ape Escape 2 contains twenty levels spread out across seven worlds.</p><p><b>World 1</b></p><ul><li>Liberty Island</li><li>Breezy Village</li><li>Port Calm</li><li>Viva Apespania</li></ul><p><b>World 2</b></p><ul><li>Castle Frightmare!</li><li>Vita-Z Factory</li><li>Casino City</li><li>Ninja Hideout</li></ul><p><b>World 3</b></p><ul><li>Snowball Mountain</li><li>Lookout Valley</li><li>The Blue Baboon</li></ul><p><b>World 4</b></p><ul><li>Enter the Monkey</li><li>Simian Citadel</li></ul><p><b>World 5</b></p><ul><li>Pirate Isle</li><li>Land of the Apes</li><li>The Lost World</li></ul><p><b>World 6</b></p><ul><li>Skyscraper City</li><li>Code C.H.I.M.P.</li></ul><p><b>World 7</b></p><ul><li>Moon Base (yes, they go to the moon)</li></ul>", "deck": "Ape Escape 2 is the PlayStation 2 sequel to 1999's critically acclaimed Ape Escape.

There are dungeons with forest, fire, and water themes, for instance, and trademark weapons and items like the bomb and <a href=\"../../boomerang/93-76/\" rel=\"nofollow\">boomerang</a> are also available. Because it was the first 3D game in the series, many innovations made their first appearance in the game play.

The children of the forest, the <a href=\"../../kokiri/92-1303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri</a>, lived with the Great Deku Tree. Each Kokiri had his or her own guardian fairy, except one. His name was <a href=\"../../link/94-191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a>.</p><p>This is where the game begins, with the player as Link, a simple young boy living with the <a href=\"../../kokiri/92-1303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri</a> tribe who are elf-like children that never grow up and can never leave the <a href=\"../../kokiri-forest/95-508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri Forest</a>. After having an inexplicable dream, the game's hero, Link, is awakened by a guardian fairy named <a href=\"../../navi/94-1176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Navi</a>. She explains that the <a href=\"../../great-deku-tree/94-2682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Deku Tree</a> has summoned him and there is no time to waste. After searching the town for the <a href=\"../../kokiri-sword/93-755/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri Sword</a>, and finding enough <a href=\"../../rupee/93-44/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rupees</a> to buy the <a href=\"../../deku-shield/93-1967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Shield</a>, Link is allowed to enter the presence of the <a href=\"../../great-deku-tree/94-2682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Deku Tree</a>. Link finds out that he has been summoned to attempt to save the Deku Tree from death after being cursed by an evil man. After defeating the curse, but failing to save the Great Deku Tree, Link is told the origin of the world of Hyrule\u2026..</p><blockquote><p>\"A long time ago . . .</p><p>Before life began, before the world had formed, three golden goddesses descended upon the chaotic land of Hyrule.</p><p>They were Din, the goddess of power, Nayru, the goddess of wisdom and Farore, the goddess of courage.</p><p>Din, with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land to create the earth.</p><p>Nayru poured her wisdom onto the earth to give the spirit of law to the world.</p><p>Farore's rich soul created all life forms who would uphold the law.</p><p>These great goddesses returned to the heavens, leaving behind the golden sacred Triforce.Since then, the Triforce has become the basis for Hyrule's providence.</p><p>Where the Triforce Stood became sacred land.\"</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822529\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822529\"><img alt=\"The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../great-deku-tree/94-2682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Tree</a> then reveals that the \u201cwicked man from the desert\u201d that cursed him was searching for one of three sacred stones, the keys to opening the door of time located in Temple of Time and gaining access to the <a href=\"../../triforce/93-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triforce</a>. After giving Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the <a href=\"../../kokiris-emerald/93-1458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri's Emerald</a>, the Deku Tree tells Link that he is different from all the other Kokiri and has a destiny that lies beyond the forest. Before he dies he sends Link to search out the other two spiritual stones, and specifically to the <a href=\"../../hyrule-castle/95-1765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Castle</a>. As the story unfolds it is learned that Link needs to stop the \u201cwicked man from the desert\u201d, named <a href=\"../../ganon/94-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganondorf</a>, from gaining access to all three pieces of the Triforce and gaining the full power of the Goddesses.</p><p>Just as Link leaves Kokiri Forest, his old friend <a href=\"../../saria/94-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saria</a> gives him the Fairy Ocarina. A musical device capable of playing numerous melodies. As he steps onto <a href=\"../../hyrule-field/95-551/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Field</a>, he meets a wise owl, <a href=\"../../kaepora-gaebora/94-3848/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaepora Gaebora</a>, who gives advice to Link on his quest. Link makes his way across the Hyrule Field and eventually arrives at Hyrule Castle. He storms through the market and reaches the castle gate. It is here that he meets <a href=\"../../malon/94-2657/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malon</a>, a dairy maid and daughter of the owner of Lon Lon Ranch, who she gives him an egg after stating that her dad is missing after doing a milk delivery. Being refused entry to the castle, Link climbs up some vines around the side of the gate and sneaks past all the guards to get into the castle. The only way in being a small trapdoor on the side of the building. However, this is blocked by a sleeping Talon, the missing owner of Lon Lon Ranch. Not being awoken by normal methods, Link waits a night and a day and the egg hatches into a Cuckoo. The Cuckoo wakes up Talon, who runs back home after he realizes that Malon is upset. Link now sneaks into the castle via the small trapdoor.</p><p>As he goes into the Castle, there are more guards patrolling the grounds. Link successfully sneaks past them and is greeted by <a href=\"../../zelda/94-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Zelda</a>. She tells the story of how Hyrule was created and how Ganondorf, the <a href=\"../../gerudo/92-858/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerudo</a> King, is trying to harness the power of the Triforce for himself. After agreeing to help the Princess, Link meets <a href=\"../../impa/94-2565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impa</a>, nurse of Zelda, who teaches him Zelda's lullaby and escorts him out of the castle, but not before giving him a note to allow him to climb <a href=\"../../death-mountain/95-69/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death Mountain.</a></p><p>Once back in Hyrule Field, Link goes back to Kokiri Forest to get Saria's Song, as it is one of the <a href=\"../../goron/92-857/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's</a> favorite songs. However, Saria is nowhere to be seen, so Link searches for her and ends up in the Lost Woods, an eerie forest which seems to be an endless maze. After Link makes his way through the Lost Woods, with the help of Kaepora Gaebora, he eventually finds Saria sitting on a tree stump. It is here Link learns Saria's Song, this allows him to ask for Saria's advice whenever he needs it wherever he may be. Link makes his way to Death Mountain, and his second Spiritual Stone.</p><p>Making his way back through Hyrule Field, Link heads for <a href=\"../../kakariko-village/95-509/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kakariko Village</a>, at the base of Death Mountain. Once here, he shows the guard guarding the entrance to Death Mountain, the letter that Impa gave him and Link is granted permission to make his way up the dangerous mountain. Avoiding various <a href=\"../../tektite/92-2883/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tektites</a> and other dangers, Link finally arrives at <a href=\"../../goron-city/95-1601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron City</a>. Encountering a locked door, Link plays Zelda's Lullaby and meets <a href=\"../../darunia/94-2559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darunia</a>, who refuses to talk to him as he is a bad mood. To brighten the atmosphere, Saria's Song is played and Darunia breaks into dance. Finally being in a good mood again, Darunia gives link the <a href=\"../../power-bracelet/93-817/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Bracelet</a>, which allows him to pick up Bomb Flowers. Using this new found strength, Link picks up a Bomb Flower and blows up the entrance to <a href=\"../../dodongos-cavern/95-565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dodongo's Cavern</a>.</p><p>Link makes his way through Dodongo's Cavern, fighting various enemies such as Keese, <a href=\"../../lizalfos/92-2878/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lizalfos</a> and Dodongos. He obtains the dungeon's treasure which are bombs. This allows him to carry bombs with him instead of depending on Bomb Flowers and the Goron Bracelet. Link makes his way through the dungeon and eventually reaches <a href=\"../../king-dodongo/94-2408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">King Dodongo</a>. After defeating King Dodongo and ridding Dodongo's Cavern of any threats, Darunia congratulates Link making him a 'brother' and gives him the second spiritual stone, the <a href=\"../../gorons-ruby/93-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's Ruby</a>.</p><p>With two out of the three spiritual stones obtained, only the <a href=\"../../zoras-sapphire/93-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zora's Sapphire</a> remains. Link makes his way to the Zora domain, gaining entrance by playing Zelda's Lullaby. He speaks to the king of the Zoras who tells him that his daughter, <a href=\"../../princess-ruto/94-2561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Ruto</a> is missing and asks Link to go find her. Link can then take part in a diving game which if he completes, it will give him the silver scale. Using his new found ability to breathe underwater for longer, Link uses the secret entrance to Lake Hylia found in Zora's domain. It is here that he finds a message in a bottle. The message states that Princess Ruto has gone to see <a href=\"../../jabun/94-3601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jabu Jabu</a>. Link shows the king this message and the king allows him to pass. Jabu Jabu has been acting strangely recently and when Link feeds him a fish, Jabu Jabu engulfs Link.</p><p>When inside Jabu Jabu, Link finds Princess Ruto, who is rather rude. Link has to escort her around the body while avoiding the enemies that plague the area. As Link reaches the end of the dungeon, he fights the dungeon boss using his new found boomerang. Once defeated, Princess Ruto is saved and she gives him the Zora's Sapphire as an engagement present stating that she will get married to Link in the future.</p><p>Now that Link has all three spiritual stones he makes his way back towards Hyrule Castle. As he reaches the gates of the market place, he sees Zelda and Impa ride out on horseback, Zelda notices Link and throws the Ocarina of Time back into the moat surrounding the castle. Just after they disappear, Ganondorf comes storming through the gates and asks Link where the princess went.

The game starts when Link is a young boy trying to stop Ganondorf from gaining the Triforce. Upon gaining access to the <a href=\"../../temple-of-time/95-1439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple of Time</a> and the <a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a>, Link travels seven years into the future. Link learns that the time travel happens because, although Link is the <a href=\"../../chosen-one/92-3870/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chosen one</a> to remove the Master Sword from its stone sealed sheath, he must be of a certain age to wield it. Therefore Link is trapped in a sort of \u201chibernation\u201d until he is old enough to fulfill his destiny. When Link awakens he finds that in his absence, Ganondorf has used the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and turn it into a post-apocalyptic world. Link must now embark on a quest to save the once beautiful land of Hyrule.</p><h2>Control Scheme</h2><p>In a situation similar to the development of <a href=\"../../super-mario-64/61-2931/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mario 64</a> (released in 1996), Nintendo faced the difficult task of translating one of gaming's most beloved franchises into <a href=\"../../3d/92-1430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3D</a>, which meant a complete overhaul of the series' classic design mechanics.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341787\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341787\"><img alt=\"Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the previous, top-down 2D Zelda games, Ocarina of Time utilized a completely 3D view. The player could control both Link's direction and the velocity of movement via the Analog Stick. The camera in Ocarina of Time floated around Link (as opposed to the greater camera controls in Super Mario 64), and could be instantly directed behind Link by pressing the Z button. Although the B button permanently controlled use of the sword, the games various other items (such as the Bow and the <a href=\"../../hook-shot/93-383/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hookshot</a>) could be mapped onto the Left, Right, and Down C-Buttons, allowing Link to access more of his weaponry without pulling up a menu.</p><p><a href=\"../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a> brought two major control innovations to bear in Ocarina of Time. The first, and most obvious, new control feature was <a href=\"../../lock-on/92-416/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lock-On Targeting</a> (referred to as Z-Targeting in the game). Pressing the Z button when Link was near a person, enemy, sign or interactive part of the environment caused the camera to lock onto the target (in game, Link's fairy, Navi, would fly to the nearby target and Link would turn his eyes directly towards Navi's new location). From the locked on position, Link could strafe around his target, use rolls and flips to dodge enemy attacks, and easily interact/talk to <a href=\"../../non-player-character/92-967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPCs </a>in three dimensional space.</p><p>The idea of locking on to a target was revolutionary: game programmers and designers, who were trying to understand how characters would be able to physically interact in 3D, couldn\u2019t understand how to make a game with the same type of tight control they could achieve in a 2D perspective. Characters could never line up properly with their targets and movement speed was too slow. Many games had control schemes that confused players. In Ocarina of Time however, players could instantly face and run directly to characters, would always be facing toward an enemy, and had more control over <a href=\"../../link/94-191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a>.</p><p>The second key innovation of Ocarina of Time was the creation of the context-sensitive buttons. Rather than map every single one of Link's abilities to a different button on the N64 controller, or only provide Link with a handful of abilities, Nintendo mapped many \"secondary\" control features to the A button. When in a certain situation or \"context\" (in front of a door, near a block, in combat, playing the Ocarina, riding Epona), the on-screen A button would display a word, indicating what the button could currently be used for (e.g. opening doors, pushing blocks, jump attacks in combat, putting the Ocarina away, speeding <a href=\"../../epona/94-1968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Epona</a> up). This was a more subtle change to the series, but Context-Sensitive buttons became the industry standard way for developers to assign controller buttons, using permanent assignment only for important actions, while letting a player use \"secondary functions\" only in the proper context.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341837\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341837\"><img alt=\"The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise for players who purchased the game was that, despite the new perspective, brand new controls, and 3D graphics, Ocarina of Time was still a full-blooded Zelda game. Sticking to its roots, the game led players through nine different dungeons, having them complete tricky puzzles and defeat big bosses along the way.</p><p>Ocarina of Time, like the Zelda games that came before it, is primarily an exploration and puzzle solving game, with sword combat, horseback riding, and boss fights playing providing a change of pace. The player progresses through the game by guiding Link to one of the nine dungeons and collecting a mystical artifact at the end (three jewels in the first half of the game, six medallions in the second half). Each of these dungeons is filled with puzzles that hinder Link's progress, and the player must solve them to continue their quest. In every dungeon (after the first one) players will encounter a \"Sub-Boss\", a powerful enemy that the player will be forced to do battle with. Defeating the Sub-Boss will lead the player to an item that will be necessary to solve puzzles farther in the dungeon. At the very end, players will encounter the Boss of the dungeon, who can only be defeated with tactical use of the new weapon retrieved in the dungeon (and some well placed sword slashes).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341913\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341913\"><img alt=\"Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D</figcaption></figure><p>Puzzles in the dungeons often share very basic similarities (there's quite a bit of time spent pushing blocks, standing on switches, and pushes blocks onto switches). However, each dungeon has a \"theme\" that changes the way the player moves through the dungeon.

Like previous <a href=\"../../the-legend-of-zelda/62-9/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zelda games</a>, the player may choose any name they want for the main character(including their own), but the default character name is Link. The name Link, according to <a href=\"../../shigeru-miyamoto/72-614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, comes from a literal interpretation of what the main character is in a video game: a link between the player and the game.</p><p>The Link featured in Ocarina of Time is not a continuation of his adventures from the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NES</a>, <a href=\"../../game-boy/60-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Game Boy</a>, and <a href=\"../../snes/93-2795/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Nintendo</a> games, but a whole new Link in a whole new story unrelated to those previous games. Ocarina of Time helped to cement the fact that the Legend of Zelda games were not a series of stories connected together in a linear timeline, but rather a retelling of the same story: different plot details, character interactions, and action sequences may occur, but the core theme(boy saves princess/world) remains the same throughout many of the main story.</p><p>The player will eventually control two different \"versions\" of Link: first as a boy, and then later as a young adult, after he <a href=\"../../time-travel/92-73/\" rel=\"nofollow\">travels forward in time</a> 7 years. This older incarnation of Link is widely regarded as the most popular representation of the series' protagonist, and fan clamor for a game starring the older, more \"mature\" Link was so strong that Nintendo obliged with the release of <a href=\"../../the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/61-19467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> in 2006 for both the <a href=\"../../gamecube/60-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GameCube</a> and <a href=\"../../wii/60-36/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wii</a>, which were designed around the mature Link aesthetic.</p><p>Link begins Ocarina of Time as a small boy, a native of the <a href=\"../../kokiri/92-1303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri</a> tribe designated as protectors of the forests of <a href=\"../../hyrule/95-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule</a>. Link is still a child in the eyes of his peers; he's the one member of the tribe that has not been granted a <a href=\"../../fairy/92-2721/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fairy</a>, a companion sprite to help him out in the world (hence his early-game nickname, \"The Boy without a Fairy). At the outset of the game, Link is trouble by strange dreams, visions of a man dressed in black from the west whose presence seems to be a threat (effectively predicting the invasion of Hyrule by <a href=\"../../ganon/94-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganondorf</a> and the Gerudo Tribe).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316573\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.276\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316573\"><img alt=\"Adult Link\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Adult Link\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Adult Link</figcaption></figure><p>As Link is awakened from his slumber, he meets <a href=\"../../navi/94-1176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Navi</a>, the fairy and companion throughout the game.

Despite Link's triumph over the monster deep inside the Tree's Roots, Link was too late to save the Great Deku Tree, as the curse had already taken its toll. With it's last wish, the Great Deku Tree gave Link a quest: he must leave the forest and travel across the world to Hyrule, and present a mysterious green stone, the <a href=\"../../kokiris-emerald/93-1458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri Emerald</a>, to Princess Zelda, implying that she would know how to stop Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule.</p><p>Link's journey will take him to the <a href=\"../../zelda/94-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Zelda</a>, and together the two would hatch a plan to defeat Ganondorf by acquiring the <a href=\"../../triforce/93-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triforce</a>, the mystical relics that helped to preserve the land and make it flourish after the goddesses created Hyrule. The Triforce was also the object of Ganondorf's desires, as the mystical triangles were able to grant any wish the holder of the relic desired. Link and Zelda decided to get to the Triforce before Ganondorf by getting to the Triforce first. To access the <a href=\"../../sacred-realm/95-1593/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sacred Realm</a> (where the Triforce has been stored by the gods), Link must locate two more sacred stones, the <a href=\"../../gorons-ruby/93-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's Ruby</a> and the <a href=\"../../zoras-sapphire/93-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zora's Sapphire</a>. Together with the Kokiri Emerald, Link and Zelda are able to open the Door of Time. When Link draws the fabled <a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a> from its pedestal from behind the door of time, he opened the Sacred Realm and access the Triforce. However, Ganon managed to get the Triforce before Link and Zelda, and with his first wish, the dark wizard declared himself the new ruler of Hyrule.</p><p>When Link returns to consciousness, he finds himself inside the fabled Chamber of Sages. Inside, he is given his next task by <a href=\"../../rauru/94-2558/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rauru</a>, the Sage of Light. In order to combat Ganon and deliver Hyrule from evil, Link must awaken the other 5 sages, denizens of Hyrule that must take on the mantle of protectors of the Triforce and Hyrule. Only Link, the legendary Hero of Time (with the power to travel between the past and future) can defeat Ganondorf's evil forces. With the power of the awakened <a href=\"../../sages-of-hyrule/92-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sages</a>, Link would be able to seal Ganondorf away inside the Sacred Realm for all time.</p><p>Upon obtaining all 6 of the Sage Medallions (designators that the sage has been awakened), Link learns that Ganondorf only managed to grab one piece of the three pronged Triforce. Ganondorf possessed the Triforce of Power, while Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage.

At first, Zelda was surprised that the young boy had managed to sneak past the guards, but when she discovers that Link had arrived in the Castle from the forest, and had a fairy companion, Zelda remembered the dream she had of the boy emerging from the forest with a fairy, and was convinced that Link was the one destined to help her keep the Triforce away from Ganondorf. Zelda tells Link of her fears about the dark wizard, and together, the two children hatch a plan to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf's evil.</p><p>To open the Door of Time and Access the <a href=\"../../sacred-realm/95-1593/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sacred Realm</a>, the pair would need to play the Song of Time on Zelda's greatest treasure, the Ocarina of Time, passed down throughout the Royal Family.</p><p>However, before Link and Zelda use the Sacred Stones to open the Door of Time, Ganondorf begins his coup in <a href=\"../../hyrule-castle/95-1765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Castle</a> and chases the Princess and her guardian <a href=\"../../impa/94-2565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impa</a> from the Castle. As they cross the gate to <a href=\"../../hyrule-castle-town/95-550/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Castle Town</a>, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the <a href=\"../../moat/93-2130/\" rel=\"nofollow\">moat</a> for Link to recover, imbued with a secret message from the princess that teaches Link how to play the Song of Time. The young Princess Zelda won't be seen again until the player has completed the game.</p><p>When Link awakens in the Temple of Time seven years in the future, he is greeted by the mysterious Sheik, the last surviving member of the Sheikah, a tribe dedicated to the protection of the royal family. Sheik describes to Link the new world, one controlled and maintained by Ganondorf from the safety of Hyrule Castle. Sheik points Link towards the first <a href=\"../../sages-of-hyrule/92-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage</a>, the Sage of the Forest, and gives Link hints about the tools he will need to help save and awaken the various Sages. Sheik will eventually teach Link special \"warp\" songs that will instantly whisk the Hero of Time to the entrance of the five dungeons, or send him back to the <a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a>'s pedestal at the Temple of Time, making the navigation of Hyrule much easier.</p><p>After Link awakens all six Sages, he returns to meet Sheik at the <a href=\"../../temple-of-time/95-1439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple of Time</a>. Sheik tells Link that, although Ganondorf was the ruler of Hyrule, his victory of the land was not complete. Ganondorf only possessed one piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Power. Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Wisdom, on the other hand, was bound on the hand of a mysterious \"seventh sage\", the leader of the other six. To Link's (and the player's) shock, Sheik removes his mask and vestments, and reveals himself to be none other than the Princess Zelda! Her disguise was a ruse to keep the Princess out of Ganondorf's clutches to protect the Triforce of Courage. As the legendary Seventh Sage, Zelda uses her power to grant Link a weapon, the mystical Arrows of Time, that could penetrate any darkness and fill it with light. However, upon revealing her true self, Ganondorf captures the Princess and brings her to Hyrule Castle. Only Link can rescue her from his clutches, so he sets off to <a href=\"../../ganons-tower/95-1764/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganon's castle</a>, and ascends to the top and faces the Evil King. Zelda is released upon Link's victory, but the tower starts to collapse, and the two have to escape before they're buried along with it. She helps open the gates that will lead the two to the exit and escape just as the building is destroyed. After a final battle between Link and Ganon, Zelda uses her powers to hold Ganon in place so Link can deliver the final blow to the beast. She then uses her powers in conjunction with the six sages to seal Ganon within the Sacred Realm. With Hyrule saved, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood, where he is supposed to be.</p><h3><a href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\">Navi the Fairy</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-395030\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92763157894737\" data-width=\"152\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 152px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-395030\"><img alt=\"\"Hey!\" \"Listen!\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" data-width=\"152\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg 152w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Hey!\" \"Listen!\"</figcaption></figure><p>Navi is one of the mysterious fairy's of the Deku Forest.

Ganondorf is from the Gerudo Tribe which is made up primarily of women except for their King and is located in the desert to the west of Hyrule. Ganondorf came to power by simply being the chosen male child to be born every hundred years. He then uses his status as King of the Gerudo to make peace with the King of Hyrule and become an adviser to the king. As a young child Princess Zelda senses something dishonest and evil about Ganondorf as he is making a truce with her father. It is through this suspicion that Princess Zelda recruits Link to help her keep Ganondorf from achieving his goal, whatever it may be. Little do they know that Ganondorf will actually use Link as a pawn to get to the Triforce.</p><h3>The Six Sages</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Forest</th></tr><tr><td><h3>Saria</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671347\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671347\"><img alt=\"Saria\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Saria\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15405/671347-sariasaage.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saria</figcaption></figure>  Main page: <a href=\"../../saria/94-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saria</a><br />The sage Link saves from the <a href=\"../../forest-temple/95-1004/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forest Temple</a>, Saria is also a childhood friend of Link's.

Can be used to make beans sprout into a transportation vine, often leading to hidden and otherwise unreachable areas.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Key Equipment</h2><ul><li>Kokiri Knife - The primary sword used by Young Link, as when he claims the Master Sword he transitions into Adult Link. The weakest of all of the swords with the smallest range.</li><li><a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a> - The main sword of the game. The second strongest sword. Can be used by Adult Link only. When placed back in the Temple of Time, the player resumes as Young Link.</li><li>Giant's Knife - Two-handed, breaks easily.</li><li>Biggoron's Sword - Two-handed, does not break. Requires completing a long task with many steps before it can be acquired.</li><li><a href=\"../../deku-shield/93-1967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Shield</a> - The first shield in the game. This is an item that cannot be used by adult Link. This is the primary shield for Young Link as it is the only shield that he can use to actually protect himself. The flaw with this shield is that it burns up if it comes into contact with any fire.</li><li><a href=\"../../hylian-shield/93-479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hylian Shield</a> - The Hylian Shield is the main shield throughout the game. It can be used for all the same things as the Deku Shield with the added benefit of being able to block fire attacks. Young Link can actually equip this shield, however it is too heavy for him to lift. When holding the trigger to block as Young Link with the Hylian Shield equipped Link simply crouches, protecting his back from damage. The only difference between this shield and the mirror shield is that it cannot reflect light.</li><li><a href=\"../../mirror-shield/93-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mirror Shield</a> - The Mirror Shield is the third shield in the game. It is found in the Spirit Temple. The mirror shield has a shiny surface and is used to be a surface to bounce light off of. This is important for completing the Spirit Temple and beating the Spirit Temple boss, Twinrova.</li><li>Kokiri Tunic - Standard green tunic. Link begins the game wearing it.</li><li>Goron Tunic - Protects against heat. Red in color.</li><li>Zora Tunic - Lets Link breathe under water. Blue in color.</li><li><a href=\"../../iron-boots/93-538/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Boots</a> - The Iron Boots are found in the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon right before entering the Water Temple. These boots are equipment modifiers like the Hover Boots and the Tunics in the game. When equipped the boots slow down Link and make him take very heavy steps. This is used to have link sink to the bottom of water so he can walk on the surface. This is necessary for completing the Water Temple.</li><li>Hover Boots - The Hover Boots are procured in the Shadow Temple and act as one of the equipment modifiers in the game as opposed to a C-Button item. When these are equipped Links steps become slippery as if he were running on ice. The benefit is that Link can run between two platforms and float a small distance between them which is good for gaining some distance.</li><li><a href=\"../../ocarina/93-62/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ocarina of Time</a> - The Ocarina of Time is the second Ocarina that Link gets in the game. The first one is the Fairy Ocarina. The Ocarina of Time can be played to warp the the entrance areas of every Temple in the game.</li><li><a href=\"../../deku-stick/93-1968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Stick</a> - These fragile sticks are a consumable weapon much like bombs. They are dropped from Deku Babas. The sticks have a long range and one of the highest damage modifiers in the game. They can also be lit and used to light sconces and torches, which is used to solve puzzles.</li><li>Fairy Slingshot - The Fairy Slingshot is the first dungeon item found in the game. It is found inside the tree dungeon as Young Link. This acts as Young Link's primary ranged weapon as the Fairy Bow acts the same way for adult Link.</li><li>Fairy Bow - The Fairy Bow is the first dungeon item found as adult Link. The Fairy Bow is found in the Forest Temple. The Fairy Bow is needed to beat Phantom Ganon and is very helpful in handling final Ganon at the end of the game. It is often used for puzzles throughout the game. There are three elemental modifiers which can be added to the arrows. The Fire Arrows are good for lighting torches on fire. The Ice Arrow is good for freezing enemies. And the Light Arrow is strong against evil.</li><li>Hookshot / Longshot - The Hookshot is needed to enter the Forest Temple as Link. This makes it one of the first necessary items to procure as adult Link. The Hookshot can be received after racing Dampe in the Kakariko graveyard. The Longshot is an upgrade for the Hookshot and acts as the dungeon weapon for the Water Temple. The Longshot is needed to reach the final boss room of the Water Temple. The Longshot is also needed for beating the Water Temple boss, Morpha</li><li>Megaton Hammer - The Megaton Hammer is found in the Fire Temple as Link. Using the C-Button that the hammer is attached to can cause the hammer to be swung horizontally to knock barriers out of the way, or hammered vertically downward to crush things. The Megaton Hammer is crucial for beating the boss of the Fire Temple, Volvagia. The Megaton Hammer is also the best way to defeat the Shadow Link mini-boss in the Water Temple. Since Shadow Link copies all sword attacks that regular Link uses switching to the Megaton Hammer confuses Shadow Link.</li><li><a href=\"../../lens-of-truth/93-1961/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lens of Truth</a> - The Lens of Truth is one of the dungeon items in Ocarina of Time. The Lens of Truth is found in the first half of the Shadow Temple when Young Link goes into the Bottom of the Well mini-dungeon. Much like the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon before the Water Temple the player receives a key item needed for Link to complete the following dungeon. The Lens of Truth is used to spot fake walls and other hidden things which Link can walk through or on. The Lens of Truth is crucial for Adult Link to navigate the Shadow Temple. It is also used to fight the Shadow Temple's boss, Bongo Bongo.</li><li>Bottles - There are four bottles to be obtained throughout Ocarina of Time. Bottles can be used to store potions, milk, fairies, or Poe ghosts. To use items like the Poe ghosts or fairies there is no need to equip the bottle. Fairies will automatically resurrect Link with full health when he dies, and the Poe ghosts can be cashed in by simply talking to the vendor.</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time received universal critical acclaim and had a huge commercial success.

He wanted players to experience what it would feel like to actually be running around in Hyrule.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/eiji-aonuma/3040-38943/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38943\">Eiji Aonuma</a> said that portions of the game (such as the<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/water-temple/3035-1002/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1002\">Water Temple</a>) would be easier because of the ability to quickly change equipment with the touchscreen. A new addition to Ocarina of Time 3D is that the Water Temple features fluorescent patterns on the walls which enable the player to find the switches to alter the water levels more easily.</p><h3>Extra Content</h3><p>In addition to the enhanced version of the original game, Ocarina of Time 3D also includes some extra content:</p><h4>Water Temple</h4><p>The Water Temple adds multiple colored lines which extend the length of the entire dungeon per floor. Each line can be found in every room in the temple. These lines each lead to one of the three doors which lead to the three points where you change the water levels. This greatly decreases the pure frustration of fans of the original release by making the temple much less maze like.</p><h4>Master Quest</h4><p>After completing the original version of Ocarina of Time 3D players will unlock <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-master-quest/3030-17278/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17278\">Master Quest</a>, which is a remixed version of the game originally released on the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Nintendo GameCube</a>. Though it is the same game at its core, the Master Quest version of Ocarina of Time 3D is fully mirrored and consist of rearranged dungeons and enemies that do twice the damage in order to be more challenging.</p><h4>Boss Challenge</h4><p>An all-new side mode which is accessible by talking to Link's bed in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/kokiri-forest/3035-508/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-508\">Kokiri Forest</a>.

He is also claiming credit for discovering the vault and defeating the <a href=\"../../the-destroyer/94-13545/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destroyer</a>.</p><p>The game starts off with four new vault hunters who are hired by Handsome Jack to discover a vault. Unfortunately Jack betrays them while they were traveling by train. The vault hunter manages to escape to a frozen part of Pandora where he encounters the last <a href=\"/claptrap/3015-4591/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4591\">Claptrap</a>. Claptrap, with help from the <a href=\"/guardian-angel/3005-14035/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14035\">Guardian Angel</a>, eventually leads the hunter to Sanctuary, the last free city on Pandora that bitterly opposes Jack and Hyperion.</p><p>The city of Sanctuary is controlled by Crimson Raiders, a group that originated from the Crimson Lance. They are led by <a href=\"/roland/3005-11164/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11164\">Roland</a> who asks the vault hunter to help him defeat Jack. As it happens, Roland was captured by the Bloodshot bandit clan before the hunter could meet him in person, and so he was tasked with rescuing him. Along the way the vault hunter meets Firehawk - <a href=\"/lilith/3005-11162/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11162\">Lilith</a> who has joined the fight against Jack, she reveals Roland's location but before he could be rescued Jack sends an army of robots to capture Roland from the bandits. Eventually, he is rescued from both the Bloodshot bandits and Hyperion robots. Once back in the Sanctuary, Roland shares the information he obtained on Jack's plan. While the Crimson Raiders knew that Jack plans on finding a vault; they didn't know he planned to control it. This particular vault isn't loaded with priceless resources, advanced alien weapons and it's not an alien prison. Rather, the vault is a living thing simply known as The Warrior. Whomever awakens it will control it; unfortunately Jack has the key. But the key is useless unless charged. It charges itself once in every two hundred years, but Jack can't wait that long. He needs a siren that can charge the key with eridium.</p><p>The next step in the fight against Hyperion leads the hunter to the best sniper, spy and scout in the Crimson Raiders, <a href=\"/mordecai/3005-11163/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11163\">Mordecai</a>. He has information on the location of Jack's vault key, and the hunter's next objective is to ambush the train that holds it and take it. Explosives were needed for the job, and it leads him to the most skilled and deadly explosives expert on Pandora, a 13 year old girl named <a href=\"/tiny-tina/3005-23715/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23715\">Tiny Tina</a>. The vault hunter proceeds to attack the train en route and attempt to take the key. As it turns out the train was simply a trap, and the key wasn't there. Instead the hunter encounters Wilhelm, a ruthless robot and one of Jack's most powerful weapons. After dealing with the robot they take his power core, an advanced piece of Hyperion technology that can help Sanctuary's energy defense stay online indefinitely. Unfortunately the power core itself is yet another trap, and the Guardian Angel betrays everyone by helping Jack shut down the city's energy defenses. This leads to the bombardment of the city by Jack's H shaped space station that orbits Pandora. With the help of Lilith and her siren abilities, Scooter and the vault hunter, the city is teleported to another location. But due to Lilith's consumption of large amounts of eridium (which was needed for the process) the hunter was accidentally left behind, and he had to make his way towards the new location of Sanctuary.</p><p>As the hunter makes his way to the new location, Angel attempts to explain herself to him. Once the vault hunter reaches Sanctuary, Angel informs everyone that the vault key is actually with her, but to get to it and thus prevent Jack from reaching the vault, resistance forces would have to pass a very difficult series of defenses set by Jack to secure the key. The first is a \"death wall\" entrance that leads to the bunker where the key is held. Only Hyperion personnel can pass through that entrance, for this task Claptrap had to be upgraded. The upgrade was actually supposed to be delivered by Bloodwing, but she got captured and it was up to the hunter to rescue her. Unfortunately Bloodwing was turned into a hideous giant monster through slag experimentation. Bloodwing could shapeshift into different elemental forms. The hunter weakened her and Mordecai attempted to tranquilize her, but Jack had explosives planted on her that he detonated as soon as the hunters took claptrap's upgrade located in Bloodwing's collar. The next challenge were Hyperion combat personnel and robots outfitted by the best equipment created by the same company, here <a href=\"/brick/3005-11161/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11161\">Brick</a> and his bandit clan, the Slabs, would help. Brick had a falling out with Roland 2 years after opening up the vault, Roland thought his methods to be too ruthless and bloodthirsty. So some convincing was needed to get Brick and his bandits to help. The last challenge was a door that only opens for Handsome Jack, for this the hunter had to kill Jack's double in Opportunity and record several examples of his voice in order to activate the door.</p><p>After all preparations for this difficult undertaking were made, the hunter set out to the bunker. Finally after fighting many enemies with the help of Brick and his bandits, they made their way to the top of the bunker where they found out that it is not a simple building but that it is actually a giant flying robot (who Jack claims he designed himself). After defeating the robot the hunters make their way to Angel's inner chamber, there they see that Angel isn't just an AI but a Siren and Jack's daughter. She was trapped in her state and was fed eridium by Jack in the effort to find the vault. She tells the hunter that in order to defeat Jack, taking the key wouldn't be enough, he had to kill her. After a long battle with Hyperion robots and with the help of Roland and Lilith the hunter manages to destroy the eridium injectors, with many objections from Jack. Without those injectors Angel could not survive. As they succeed in their objective Jack teleports to them, kills Roland and captures Lilith.</p><p>In light of these events the hunter returns to Sanctuary where he receives orders from Mordecai. Mordecai suggests that in order to defeat Jack once and for all, they'd have to find the vault In order to do so. However the vault hunter would have to access a Hyperion info stockade to get the location of the vault, and in order to get to the stockade he'd need very high grade explosives to breach the way. The info stockade is located in <a href=\"/fyrestone/3035-4172/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4172\">Fyrestone</a>, now occupied by Hyperion forces. Once there the hunter learn that Jack has been transporting very large amounts of eridium to Hero's Pass. He leaves for Hero's Pass where, alongside Mordecai and Brick, fights a very large amount of Hyperion soldiers and robots. Brick and Mordecai are eventually overwhelmed and fall into lava. The vault hunter reachs The Vault of the Warrior, where he sees Jack for the second time in person. Before The Warrior is summoned the hunter fights Jack and defeats him. As he's about to land the killing blow The Warrior is summoned and is under Jack's command. After a very long and difficult battle The Warrior is bested by the hunter. Mordecai and Brick appear while Lilith takes the key and tries to destroy it but as she does a map showing several galaxies and planets with vaults appears.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>General</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2265314\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2265314\"><img alt=\"The Gunzerker, and one of his skill trees.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 1200w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Gunzerker, and one of his skill trees.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 1200w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Gunzerker, and one of his skill trees.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay is similar to the original, although with many enhancements. Players start by picking a character class and then progress through quests, earning money, experience, and equipment in the process. Unlike the original, weapon proficiency is not based on class. Defeating enemies earns experience points and loot in the form of weapons, ammunition, grenade mods, shields, etc. Loot is also available in a variety of chests, safes, cabinets, lockers, and refuse piles. Borderlands 2 uses a randomization system to generate loot.</p><p>Characters have separate health and shield values; should the player's shield deplete and health reach zero, he or she will enter \"Fight for your Life\" mode. In this mode, players are given a short period of time to kill an enemy and gain a \"second wind.\" In solo play, players must kill an enemy to continue; in co-op play, they must kill someone <i>or</i> must be revived by a teammate. Co-op players get more time to survive/be revived. Without a kill or help from a teammate, the character dies and respawns at the last save point. Hyperion Corporation also charges the player a percentage of their money for the privilege of respawning, with an occasionally snarky voiceover. If the player is very low on funds the fee will be waived.</p><p>As players gain experience and level up, they can distribute skill points to the current character. Each class has a unique action skill and three skill trees loosely organized around a particular style of play. Each increase in level also brings an increase to health and damage dealt, and a decrease to damage received. The level cap is currently set at 50 but, as with the original game, the cap may be raised later by <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">Downloadable Content</a>. Once players complete the first playthrough with a character, they have the option of using the character in True Vault Hunter mode, basically a new playthrough with tougher enemies and better loot. After completing the second playthrough, a third, or playthrough 2.5 is entered, where enemies and loot scale up to level 50.</p><p>Announced at Gearbox's PAX East 2013 panel, with the help of a $5 (400 MSP) add-on for the title (unless one has the season pass), those who are maxed out at level 50 will be able to level up to 61. Additionally, Pearlescent weapon types, a set of rare finds in <a href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\">Borderlands</a>, would populate the sequel with possible drops.</p><h4>Badass Ranks</h4><p>Yet another new addition to Borderlands 2 is a system called badass ranks. The player may complete ingame challenges, like killing a certain amount of enemies with a shotgun, or scoring critical hits with a sniper rifle or finding vault symbols at given locations and many other challenges. The challenges are grouped into several tiers. The 1st tier gives 1 badass rank, the 2nd 5, the 3rd 10, 4th 50, and the 5th 100. Once enough badass ranks are attained the player gains a token that can be used on improving various statistics, like critical hit damage, gun damage, shield capacity, maximum health and so on. These improvements are rather small, with diminishing returns on several upgrades, but the badass rank system has infinite levels. The badass rank (along with the improvements) are carried out to all characters. And every new character created by the player starts with all the challenges reset, thus allowing the player to acquire an infinite number of badass ranks and therefor badass tokens. Due to a player being able to theoretically gain a huge advantage with improvements from tokens, Gearbox added the option of turning off the improved statistics so that the game wouldn't be too easy.</p><p>Players can buy new equipment and sell unwanted equipment at the numerous vending machines located throughout Pandora. The items on offer will depend on the location of the vending machine, <i>not</i> character level, with the exception of vending machines in Sanctuary, which do scale by level. Each type of vending machine sells certain types of equipment, as follows:</p><ul><li>Weapon Vending Machines - sells only weapons;</li><li>Ammunition Vending Machines - sells ammo and grenade mods;</li><li>Medical Vending Machines - sells shields, class mods, artifacts, and health regenerating items.</li></ul><p>A new addition to Borderlands 2 is the Black Market run by Crazy Earl. There the player can buy upgrades (backpack slots, bank slots, maximum ammo limits) in exchange for refined eridium.</p><p>Borderlands 2 offers vastly improved character customization options. In the first game, players could only choose basic clothing colors and character names. Borderlands 2 features a wider variety of color schemes, as well as distinctive head wear that can be found in shops, loot drops, slot machines, and by completing quests. Unlocked color schemes and specific headwear apply only to the active character, although a character may find skins and headwear for other classes. Vehicles also have distinct skins and collectable customization mods.</p><p>Borderlands 2 features split-screen for all platforms. Local and online co-op may be combined, so that two players can play split-screen locally with two other online friends. However, only two players may play in split-screen at any given time, as the game requires one person to be the host. The host cannot play split-screen due to the CPU burden.</p><h3>Missions</h3><p>Borderlands 2 features an <a href=\"../../open-world/92-207/\" rel=\"nofollow\">open world</a> with main and side missions provided by various NPCs and bounty boards. Some missions include an optional objective, such as killing a certain NPC with a certain weapon, or killing x number of bandits. The completion of side missions and optional objectives leads to the completion of challenges.</p><h3>Transportation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167580\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167580\"><img alt=\"Much like the original, the game features vehicular combat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 3840w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Much like the original, the game features vehicular combat.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 3840w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Much like the original, the game features vehicular combat.</figcaption></figure><p>The player can use vehicles or fast travel or a combination of both in order to traverse the world in a speedy manner. Like the original there is a fast travel system as well as vehicles. Vehicles have a turbo boost, that increases the speed at which the vehicle travels. Unlike the first game, vehicles no longer have shields, but just a general amount of hit points, and once depleted the vehicle will explode leading to all characters who were garrisoned inside to go through second wind. In the first game the only vehicle available was the Runner, it has 2 seats, one for the driver and one for the gunner. In Borderlands 2, there will be several \"families\" of vehicles, for example Bandit Technical, or a Light Runner. There is a new feature that allows players to equip relics that improve a vehicles performance, thus increasing various statistics. Another feature is a more robust customization option, featuring many color schemes for different vehicles. As in the previous game players can access their vehicles through \" <i>Catch-A-Ride</i>\" that is run by <a href=\"/scooter/3005-13587/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13587\">Scooter</a> along with his sister <a href=\"/ellie/3005-23816/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23816\">Ellie</a>.</p><p>There is a new type of flying vehicle, that is unfortunately only available to enemies.</p><h3>Multiplayer options</h3><p>Like the previous version Borderlands 2 will have options for <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-op play</a>. This can be done on using a LAN or online using an internet connection. The <a href=\"/drop-in-drop-out/3015-1553/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1553\">drop-in\\drop-out</a> option is again available for players to join a running game instantly. You can play with up to three <a href=\"/4-player-co-op/3015-2563/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2563\">friends in a co-op game</a>. You can also challenge your friends to a duel.</p><p>Trading equipment between players is now friendlier than ever. When both players want to exchange stuff, they both need to press the exchange buttons and can then offer weapons, ammo and other equipment to each other. You pay with another weapon or equipment and can add extra money if needed. When both parties agree, the deal is done.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Weapons played a big role in the original game, this is true for Borderlands 2 as well. Weapons, like enemies and characters, have a level, this determines their stats. As the players gain levels they will find better, higher level weapons. Weapons dropped or found as loot are always random, in their appearance, quality and stats. However, there are certain unique weapons that are given to the player after certain quests, and legendary weapons that can drop from loot-able objects or defeated enemies. Weapons in Borderlands 2 have more variety, both in terms of their mechanics and appearance, when compared to the first game. An example would be a rocket launching assault rifle or a sniper rifle with 3 barrels that spin once fired for a faster fire rate. Weapons have several stats, and some even have a chance of inflicting elemental damage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187150\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187150\"><img alt=\"The player using a scoped weapon to fight off a pack of enemies.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 750w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The player using a scoped weapon to fight off a pack of enemies.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 750w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The player using a scoped weapon to fight off a pack of enemies.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapon stats include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/damage-numbers/3015-2106/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2106\">Damage</a></li><li>Rate of Fire</li><li>Magazine Size</li><li>Reload Speed</li><li>Chance for Elemental Effects on Hit</li><li>Elemental Damage per Second</li><li>Value</li><li>Rarity</li></ul><p>Loot, weapons, and equipment have colored names to help identify their rarity - a feature seen in many other RPG titles:</p><ul><li><b>White</b> - average or common.</li><li><b>Green</b> - a little above average.</li><li><b>Blue</b> - uncommon.</li><li><b>Purple</b> - rare.</li><li><b>Orange/Gold</b> - legendary.</li><li><strong>Pink </strong>- \"E-Tech\"</li></ul><p>Unique weapons that are given as quest rewards can never be white, legendary weapons can only be orange/gold.</p><p>The \"pearlescent\" quality weapons added to the first game by the Secret Armory Of <a href=\"../../general-knoxx/94-14034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Knoxx</a> won't be making a return in the base game.</p><p>Apart from that, weapons can have certain abilities such as increasing damage, or firing speed, or magazine size etc. Weapons can also have an elemental modifier, that deal fire, shock, acid, or explosive damage. A new elemental modifier is slag, which covers an enemy in a purple goo-like substance that directly increases the damage other elemental modifiers do. Some items also have extra bonuses for equipping other items, or having multiple players equipping the same item.</p><p>The players can choose from <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotguns</a>, semi automatic <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistols</a> (revolvers are no longer separated into a different category), assault rifles, <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launchers</a>, SMGs, and <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifles</a>. Eridian Weapons do not reappear, although there's a new weapon type known as E-Tech that utilizes eridium. Each class has a specific <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee attack</a> (Zer0 has a <a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">sword</a>), which cannot be changed but can be upgraded through the bloodshed skill tree. The damage done also increases with higher levels. A good way of finding weapons is to loot weapon <a href=\"/treasure-chest/3055-517/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-517\">chests</a>, finding a weapon is guaranteed, but the type of weapon as well as its stats, appearance and level are random. One new addition to gameplay allows Tediore weapons to be thrown as explosives once used, instead of reloaded, with damage done corresponding to the amount of ammo left in the clip when thrown/reloaded. The gun re-digistructs in the players hand so they can continue to use that weapon.</p><h3>Weapon Manufacturers</h3><p>The weapons of Borderlands 2 have distinct visual characteristics, allowing the player to recognize a gun's maker through sight alone. The game will feature different weapon manufacturers that design and produce all kinds of weapons, ranging from semi automatic pistols and revolvers to rocket launchers and heavy machine-guns.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862436\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67377049180328\" data-width=\"610\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862436\"><img alt=\"Bandit weapon concept art.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 610w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bandit weapon concept art.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 610w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1862436-bandit600.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bandit weapon concept art.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Bandit -</b> In the five years after the first game, bandits have taken to making their own weapons. Bandit weapons have a makeshift look, Instead of iron sights, for example, a Bandit weapon might have a bolt screwed into the top of the gun. Bandit weapons have the largest magazines, replacing S&amp;S Munitions from the first game.</li><li><b>Dahl -</b> \" <i>Dahl's guns absorb a lot of recoil, allowing you to stay accurate throughout the fight!\"</i> Dahl weapons stick more closely to the weapons seen in modern military shooters. Dahl weapons have the lowest recoil and seem to be marketed as mercenary weapons. They also fire in bursts when aiming down the iron sites or scopes.</li><li><b>Hyperion -</b> \"<i>Hyperion asks, what good is a gun that doesn't shoot where you point? Get a gun that's as accurate as you are!\"</i> Hyperion weapons will have a similar aesthetic to the <a href=\"/claptrap/3015-4591/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4591\">Claptrap</a> robots from the first game (which are also manufactured by the same company). Hyperion tends to focus on accuracy, making the most accurate guns on Pandora. These guns are different to most because the longer that you shoot the higher the accuracy goes, becoming more accurate at the end of the clip.</li><li><b>Vladof -</b> \"<i>Want to shoot a lot of bullets really fast?</i> Vladof has your needs covered!\" Vladof weapons have the highest firing rate of any other firearms manufacturer, and their weapons tend to have very large clips. It would appear that Vladof is a Russian manufacturer, judging by the name of their weapons.</li><li><b>Tediore -</b> \"<i>Cheap, reliable, lightweight, and incredibly fast reload speeds. Tediore makes an easy-to-use gun!\"</i> These weapons are disposable. After fully unloading a clip, the gun can be used as a thrown explosive. The more ammo left in the clip when you throw it, the more powerful the explosion. The gun will then be reconstructed out of your Digistruct module. In the first game Tediore weapons regenerated ammo. Tediore guns (for Borderlands 2) have been described as \"Cheap, plastic pieces of crap\" and \"Wal-Mart guns\" by <a href=\"/randy-pitchford/3040-4430/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4430\">Randy Pitchford</a>.</li><li><b>Torgue - \"</b> <i>Torgue combines good damage, high fire rate, and recoil reduction into one lethal weapon.\"</i> Heavy duty and high powered guns. Torgue weapons aren't exceptional in any one area, but are balanced and always make a big boom.</li><li><b>Maliwan - \"</b><i>Is shooting bullets just not cool enough for you? Get a Maliwan, and light some people on fire!\"</i> All of Maliwan guns have an elemental modifier, fire, shock, explosion, acid or slag. Slag being the new elemental modifier, it increases the damage from all other sources.</li><li><b>Jakobs - \"</b><i>If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!</i><b>\"</b> These weapons are a cross between wild west guns and WW2 era guns that have high damage stats and firing as fast as you can pull the trigger.

As a veteran soldier, he is skilled both by his grit (allowing him to maintain his position), excellence with standard military weaponry (especially assault rifles, rocket launchers, and grenades), and reliance on his pet Sabre <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/turret/3055-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-43\">turret</a> (which has a variety of dangerous upgrades). His melee weapon of choice is his trusty <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/throwing-axe/3055-3433/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3433\">Tomahawk</a>.</p><p>A cocky former sergeant of the Dahl military force, Axton escaped death by firing squad (after being discharged from the military due to numerous compromised missions as a result of his disobedience) by fleeing to the border worlds. After being bored by becoming one of the most successful bounty hunters in Pandora, he hears of the Vault through a targeted radio advertisement by Handsome Jack.</p><h4>Action Skill - Sabre Turret</h4><p>Similar to Roland's Scorpio Turret action skill from the original Borderlands, Axton can deploy a stationary <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/automated-sentry-gun/3055-68/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-68\">automated sentry gun</a> that can fire streams of bullets at nearby enemies. While this turret cannot resupply health and ammo like the Scorpio Turret (but can now rotate a full 360 degrees), Axton can add a variety of unique upgrades to make it deadlier in the battlefield:</p><ul><li>Improve the turret's firing rate (through extra ammunition belts, also giving it a longer duration) and accuracy (through an <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">optical laser sight</a>).</li><li>Attach multiple rocket pods on the top of the turret, which can fire a volley of deadly rockets against clusters of enemies.</li><li>Utilize Longbow technology, so that Axton can deploy the turret to a faraway position instantly using teleportation.</li><li>Deploy a protective shield around the turret when deployed, which blocks most ranged enemy attacks (while letting friendly enemy attacks pass through).</li><li>Attach mag-lock bases to the turret, allowing it to stick on surfaces (including walls and ceilings) during deployment.</li><li>Add a second gun on the turret (while giving bullets Slag properties).</li><li>Deploy a small nuclear blast around the turret when deployed (dealing explosive damage while setting enemies on fire).</li><li>Allow Axton to deploy another turret shortly after the other, allowing for two turrets simultaneously on the battlefield.</li></ul><h4>Skill Tree</h4><p>The Guerrilla skill tree primarily focuses on improving the Sabre Turret's weaponry while improving Axton's survivability in close-ranged combat.

Preferring direct combat, Salvador is skilled in his physical toughness, weapon maintenance (including swapping between weapons, reloading guns, and retaining ammunition), and ability to throw himself into a powerful rage (allowing him to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wield</a> his weapons). His melee weapon of choice is his fists (which can be upgraded into a powerful uppercut).</p><p>Born and raised in the Pandora village of Ovejas, Salvador is a gun-loving fighter who, thanks to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/steroids/3055-2491/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2491\">steroid</a> abuse throughout his life, has a short stature. While being sentenced to death by hanging (for \"murdering\" a group of bandits), the village becomes attacked by a Hyperion occupation force (under orders from Handsome Jack). After flying into a rage and single-handedly killing the attackers, he learns of the Vault through the one soldier he left alive (but broken).</p><h4>Action Skill - Gunzerking</h4><p>Similar to Brick's Berserk action skill from the original Borderlands, Gunzerking allows Salvador to enter a mode of pure rage, giving him serious damage output and damage resistance while constantly regenerating his health over time. Unlike Berserk, where Brick must attack with his fists, Gunzerking lets Salvador use two weapons at once. Activating the skill automatically heals half of his health and instantly reloads his equipped weapons. Salvador also constantly regenerates his ammo over time (for all weapons except rockets and grenades).</p><p>Through certain upgrades, Salvador can buff himself while Gunzerking with:</p><ul><li>Increased duration (further increased by killing an enemy), health regeneration rate (up to a certain percentage), and movement speed.</li><li>Increased weapon damage (when wielding two weapons of the same type) or weapon accuracy (when wielding two weapons of different types).</li><li>Significantly reduced weapon recoil while giving him a random chance of buffing his weapon accuracy when shooting an enemy.</li><li>The ability to trigger the skill (or remain in the skill) during Fight For Life mode.</li><li>The ability to throw two grenades at once (with the other grenade not using up his grenade capacity).</li><li>Increased firing rate and reloading speed while holding down the trigger.</li><li>The ability to taunt all nearby enemies, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/aggro/3015-105/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-105\">making them more likely to target him</a> while instantly giving him both full health and massive damage reduction for a few seconds.</li></ul><p>In addition, Salvador can increase the skill's cooldown rate using a certain upgrade (while using another upgrade to further increase it by shooting at enemies). Another upgrade can increase his base damage while the skill is cooling down.</p><h4>Skill Tree</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Gun Lust</th><th>Rampage</th><th>Brawn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Locked and Loaded - Reloading a gun gives bonus fire rate for a short time.</li><li>Quick Draw - Weapon swap speed and critical hit damage increased with all gun.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Inconceivable - Shots have a chance to not consume ammo.

She has an ability called 'phaselock', as well as skills that allow her to drain health from enemies, revive allies, increase bullet speed and damage, and reflect enemy bullets. Like Lilith, Maya is a Siren, a powerful female being capable of incredible powers.</p><p>Maya was raised by The Order of the Impending Storm that rule the planet of Athenes, her parents fate is unknown. Once it was discovered that she is a siren she was trained since childhood to protect the order and people of Athenes. Once Maya reached adulthood brother Sophis, the head of the order, brought a terrorist before her for punishment. Having seen the siren the prisoner begins to beg for his life in fear of her powers, saying that he'll pay the tithe. Once Maya hears this she becomes enraged to learn that the order had used to her to keep the people docile, she kills brother Sophis and goes to Pandora to learn more of her siren heritage.</p><h4>Action Skill - Phaselock</h4><p>Similar to Lilith's Phasewalking ability Maya uses her siren powers to affect the environment around her but instead of maneuvering around the battlefield she locks her victim in a bubble extra-dimensional energy. Phaselocking allows Maya, and any vault hunter with her, to attack the enemy inside the bubble with no restrictions.

There's only one occasion where Marcus decided to give out refunds. He got drunk one night and started thinking about all of his unhappy customers, after which he started mailing out refunds. As soon as he became sober he hired the vault hunter to get the refunds back, he swore to never drink Rakk ale again. Any other time should a customer come back demanding one Marcus will test the weapon, usually by shooting the unhappy customer.</p><h3><a href=\"/scooter/3005-13587/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13587\">Scooter</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2338125\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2338125\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 1360w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 1360w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/2338125-borderlands2_2012_09_22_18_50_04_78.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Scooter is a savant mechanic.

Scooter despises anyone who attempts to hack one of his catch-a-ride machines, even hiring the vault hunter to kill a bandit that attempted it.

Apart from his day to day job of owning and maintaining catch-a-ride, Scooter also maintains the city of Sanctuary, and eventually helps get it airborne. He also has an interest in getting to and finding out what second base is.

When the camp's supervisors realize that Raz has run away from home, they call his parents and tell them to pick him up the next day, but due to the surprising strength of Raz's mind, they allow him to train until his parents arrive.</p><p>His training begins with <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1342\" href=\"/oleanders-basic-braning/3035-1342/\">Coach Oleander's training ground</a>. This war torn mind acts a tutorial level, explaining all the elements (figments, emotional baggage, mental cobwebs and vaults) Raz will encounter during his adventures as a mind traveler.</p><p>After completing Basic Braining, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1572\" href=\"/sasha-nein/3005-1572/\">Sasha Nein</a> invites Raz to his laboratory for further research. In the lab, Nein tells him he would like to try the Brain Tumbler on Razputin, which is a machine that allows the one who uses it to access the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1182\" href=\"/collective-unconscious/3035-1182/\">Collective Unconscious</a>, a network of all the minds Raz has entered. From here, Sasha instructs Raz to enter his own mind.</p><p>At first, everything in Raz's mind seems sound, as he sees images of his childhood. Eventually, however, he starts to see things that he doesn't understand, such as meat, steaks, and a curious rabbit, which Nein dismisses as a primal fear or memory. Raz continues along until he finds a shadowy monster that spits a diving helm at him just before Nein pulls him out of the experiment since it is too dangerous for Raz to continue without the right abilities. He's instructed to ask <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1900\" href=\"/ford-cruller/3005-1900/\">Ford Cruller</a> for permission to learn the Psi-Blast ability.</p><p>After receiving clearance, Sasha teaching Raz how to use Psi-Blast. Raz enters Sasha's shooting gallery -- a cube and close representation of how Sasha's mind is like: sparse and organized. Sasha leaves Raz alone to practice his Psi-Blast ability against censors, allowing him to chose how many will pop out at a time. Being a rush to become a Psychonaut, Raz tries to set it to the maximum level, but ends up breaking the machine instead, therefore unleashing chaos on Sasha's mind. After closing all the censor dispensers, a \"Mega-Censor\" appears due to build-up from all the dispensaries being closed. When Raz defeats it, Sasha gives him the the marksmanship merit badge and prepares to send Raz back into his own mind to face the monster.</p><p>Raz re-enters his psyche, Psi-Blasts the monster's face, and proceeds following the mysterious bunny when he reaches a creepy tower. In it, he sees <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2035\" href=\"/dogen-boole/3005-2035/\">Dogen</a> and what appears to be a blue skinned, psychotic dentist who's set on removing Dogen's brain. Raz tries to reach him, but is unable. Sasha tells him to attend <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1566\" href=\"/milla-vodello/3005-1566/\">Milla Vodello's</a> levitation class in order to save the poor about to be brainless kid.</p><p>He goes to Milla's levitation class, enters Milla's party crazy mind, and finally learns levitation. Before learning it, though, he sees Lilly and they end up discussing the nightmares they've been having that are, coincidentally, extremely similar, and decide to meet that night at the lake. Afterwards, Razputin returns to get his brain tumbled once more.</p><p>He uses his levitation ability to glide thanks the floating powers of rotten meat stench (yes, it's true) and gets inside the tower only to discover that the insane dentist has already removed it with super sneezing powder, which makes anyone who smells it to sneeze and expel his brain. That's how powerful this powder is. But not only that, he also finds <a data-ref-id=\"3005-947\" href=\"/lili-zanotto/3005-947/\">Lili</a>, Raz's love interest, in the same tower. But <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3673\" href=\"/dr-caligosto-loboto/3005-3673/\">Loboto</a> (the dentist) just closed the door behind him. So Raz's only option is to go save Dogen's brain. He goes into the sewer system where Loboto's just thrown the brain only to encounter a psychic tank that picks up Dogen's brain and uses it to work properly. After defeating the psycho tank, Raz ends up in a white room incredibly similar to one that was in Oleander's mind, and discovers the coach's plans to take over the world by building an army of these psychic death tanks that run on human brains. Sasha pulls him out only to tell Raz that he has to go on \"official Psychonauts business\" without even letting Raz explain what he's just discovered. But the agent has left one crucial item behind, the Psycho-portal, which allows to go into other people's minds. Raz picks it up and continues to explore on his own. But he will eventually have to go to the meeting with Lilly at the lake. They talk about Oleander's plans and how they need to do something about and Lilly does get a bit too excited about it and asks Raz to kiss her, but all this joy is interrupted by the appearance of a giant lungfish who swallows Lili and takes her underwater. Raz follows the lungfish by getting inside a giant diving helm and confronts it and when he finally beats it he learns that the lungfish used to be normal but Dr Loboto and Oleander have transformed it into what it is now. To save Lilly, Raz must get into the mutated lungfish's mind.</p><p>Inside its mind, or <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1153\" href=\"/lungfishopolis/3035-1153/\">Lungfishopolis</a> (because that's the name of the level), Raz will have to free the lungfish resistance who are trying to fight against a mysterious entity known as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3676\" href=\"/kochamara/3005-3676/\">Kochamara</a> that since it has arrived has been terrifying the poor inhabitants of Lungfishopolis. In this mind Raz is a giant that the lungfish have named Goggalor, and are very hostile towards him. After freeing the resistance, acquiring the Shield ability and reaching the island where Kochamara is emitting his broadcast from a radio tower that the resistance have told Raz to destroy to end Kochamara's reign, Raz fights the other giant which is none other than a projection of coach Oleander that helps him control the giant lungfish's mind. Raz defeats him, destroys the tower and frees Linda (that's the name of the lungfish). After that Raz asks Linda to take him where he left Lilly, and the latter swallows our hero and transports him to the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-703\" href=\"/thorney-towers/3035-703/\">Thorney Towers Home for the Disturbed</a> asylum.</p><p>At the entrance he will find the guard, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1276\" href=\"/boyd-cooper/3005-1276/\">Boyd</a>, who seems extremely troubled and can't stop rambling things about some milkman. Boyd won't open the door for Raz, so he must help him fight his personal demons. One Psycho-portal to the face later and Raz enters the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1133\" href=\"/milkman-conspiracy/3035-1133/\">Milkman Conspiracy</a> level. In this level Raz will have to help Boyd find the milkman, since it's the element that seems to bother him so much. Raz obtains the clairvoyance power and discovers that Boyd thinks the Milkman is dead, so Raz goes to the cemetery to check. But first he will have to do a series of errands since agents are heavily guarding the area also looking for the Milkman and all the milk conspirators and won't let him go through certain places if he doesn't have the right item. After obtaining some flowers and passing as a grieving widow, Raz enters the graveyard only to discover that the Milkman is not dead. Exploring a bit further he discovers that the Milkman is guarded by some girls called the Rainbow Squirt and their leader, the Den Mother. Raz fights and defeats the latter and thus freeing the Milkman which actually is Boyd's hidden persona, an arsonist disguised as a milkman who uses milk bottles as Molotov cocktails. The guard/milkman/arsonist opens the doors to the asylum and just stands with a Molotov cocktail in front of the main building, not knowing if he should throw it or not... the worst is yet to come.</p><p>Inside the asylum grounds Raz will have to disguise himself as Dr. Loboto since his sidekick <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3672\" href=\"/crispin/3005-3672/\">Crispin</a> won't let him get to the top. Thankfully he can't see very well and a cheap disguise will do. Raz will need to get a claw-like trophy from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3678\" href=\"/gloria-von-gouton/3005-3678/\">Gloria Von Gouton</a> the fallen actress, a straitjacket from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3679\" href=\"/fred-bonaparte/3005-3679/\">Fred Bonaparte</a>, a descendant of Napoleon who thinks he's possessed by his ancestor, and a painting of Dr Loboto from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3680\" href=\"/edgar-teglee/3005-3680/\">Edgar Teglee</a> the bullfight obsessed artist.</p><p>After helping Gloria fight her personal demons, which in this case are represented as an angry critic who won't let her perform, winning a battle against a mental representation of Napoleon Bonaparte in Fred's mind and helping Edgar Teglee get over his failed relationship with a cheerleader, Raz obtains the three items that will get him to the top of the tower.</p><p>While climbing the tower a strange stalker will follow him, which we discover that it's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3674\" href=\"/sheegor/3005-3674/\">Sheegor</a>, Dr Loboto's scared assistant. She will agree to help him if he rescues Mister Pokeylope, which is none other than a turtle and Sheegor's weird pet. So Raz rescues Mr Pokeylope, gives it to Sheegor and Pokeylope in his deep, Barry White-esque voice tells us the new plan. Sheegor will have to get Pokeylope's brain out, and with Raz's telekinetic powers he will put it in a machine that enhances Pokeylope's mental powers to blast Dr Loboto. They succeed, recranealize Sasha's and Milla's brains and free Lili. But Oleander comes to crash the party and wants Raz's brain. Ford Cruller comes to join the fight and the Psychonauts leave the kids out of it by picking them up (mentally) and dropping them at the entrance of the asylum.</p><p>Meanwhile, Edgar who feels well and wants to leave the asylum but couldn't because he was chained to a gas pipe, breaks the chains but also the pipe, but it's okay because there's no gas coming out. Until Gloria who wants water to irrigate the flowers accidentally opens the wrong valve, and activates the gas. Boyd realizes he's no longer the Milkman and throws his last Molotov cocktail into the asylum. Like you would have guessed by now, the asylum blows up, the debris almost crushing Raz and Lili who were just kissing, but Raz activated his shield in time. They meet Nein, Vodello and Cruller who seem to have won the battle as they see Oleander completely brainless (Cruller used the sneezing powder on him) but his brain somehow managed to get into a Psychic Tank. The tank blasts the Psychonauts and Lili unconscious, leaving Raz being the only one to dodge it.</p><p>After fighting and beating the tank, Raz goes check it, a terrible mistake because the tank releases some sneezing powder and Raz despite trying not to sneeze expels his brain. Now the only thing he can do is use his telekinesis power to pick himself (or rather his brain) up and put it inside the tank, along with Oleander's brain. This causes the two mind to fuse together and thus creating the last level, the Meat Circus.</p><p>Raz's and Oleander's memories of their childhood are now mixed together and it's up to Raz to undo this mess. Raz will have to help young Oleander save his bunny (that his father, a butcher, killed) through the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1814\" href=\"/meat-circus/3035-1814/\">Meat Circus</a>. After saving the bunny Raz will fight mental representations of Oleander's father and Raz's father. After doing this, Raz's real father will enter Raz's mind (or rather the mess that is the Meat Circus), revealing that he himself is a psychic, and that he only wanted Raz to be safe from situations like this. The final boss are the two evil visions of Raz and Oleander's respective fathers combined. Raz's real father will give him all his mental power to become some sort of giant Raz that will be able to beat them. He succeeds and the two minds are separated.</p><p>Oleander is finally free from his personal demons and apologizes to everyone who was affected by his evil endeavors, and Raz is awarded for his bravery by becoming an official Psychonaut, but alas, Lili has to return back home. Just when we thought everything was over, the Psychonauts receive a message saying that Lili's father, who turns out to be the leader of the Psychonauts, has been kidnapped. They all go to the mission in a ship and the game ends, hinting at a sequel that may hopefully come one day.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The world of Psychonauts is full of many odd, creative characters.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288970\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288970\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg 800w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4737/288970-razputin.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure></td><td>The main protagonist of the game, Razputin (Raz for short), left his home of the circus to join the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-187\" href=\"/whispering-rock-psychic-summer-camp/3035-187/\">Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp</a>.

Linda gains Raz access to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1153\" href=\"/lungfishopolis/3035-1153/\">Lungfishopolis</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay consists of traditional platforming elements combined with puzzles and obstacles that must be thwarted using Raz's ever-increasing arsenal of psychic powers. During the course of his adventures Raz learns new powers, including telekinesis, invisibility, and pyrokinesis. While proper use of these new abilities is necessary for completing the game's main story, Psychonauts allows for more creative uses of Raz's powers on friends and foes alike, often resulting in entertaining results.</p><h3>Collectibles</h3><p>Like any good modern platformer, Psychonauts offers tons of collectibles for the player to get. Certain collectibles will allow Raz to advance in rank which is necessary for him to learn new powers or upgrade them while others are just there to learn a bit more about certain characters and their background or the development process of the game.</p><p>Psi-cards and psi-cores are the first collectibles the player will find. In order to advance one rank the player will need to find nine Psi-cards, combine them with a Psi-core using a machine in Ford Cruller's headquarters that will make Raz advance a whole rank. Nine Psi-cards with a Psi-core is called a Psi Challenge Marker. It's pretty rare to find them in their original form, and reaching them is usually a challenge.</p><p>While exploring other people's minds Raz will collect figments of their imagination. These are pretty common and each one of them have a certain number of points assigned to them. When Raz has collected 100 of these \"figment points\" he will advance one rank. Raz starts the game at level 1, and the maximum level is 99.</p><p>Emotional baggage in this game is literally what the name says. Crying suitcases, purses, steam trunks and whatnot. To be precise in every mind there is a suitcase, purse, duffle bag, steam trunk and a hatbox that has to be assigned to their respective tags. Once this is done their Primal Memories will be unlocked which is actually art concepts scripts and etc that the developers have used for making the game.</p><p>Raz will also find in all the minds he enters Mental Cobwebs that plague the mental landscape. To retrieve them he will need a cobweb duster and if he brings them to the machine in Cruller's headquarters it will make him progress one rank for each cobweb collected.</p><p>Mental vaults contain memories of the person's mind he's exploring that are important and contain a diaporama explaining a bit of that specific character's background.</p><p>Finally by the last half of the game Raz will have to recuperate his fellow psycadets brains for reasons explained in the plot section. Each brain will give him one mental health point which is represented by a little brain in his health bar.</p><h3>Merit Badges, Psychic Powers and Upgrades</h3><p>Throughout the adventure, Raz will get Merit Badges that allow him to use different psychic powers and get to different areas in the camp. These merit badges he receives will either be given to him for completing a certain level or by obtaining a specific rank.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><thead><tr><th>Badge / Power</th><th>Description</th><th>Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic Braining</td><td>First badge obtained in the game;

Tim Shafer estimated that the game had sold 400,000 units across all 4 platforms. The units sold only refer to physical (disc) copies of the game sold at retailers, and not copies sold through digital distribution services or the store at the Double Fine website. It's unknown if and how much of the digital sales Double Fine receives. Often jokingly Schafer has stated if gamers wish to support Double Fine because they enjoyed Psychonauts they should pirate the game and then buy a t-shirt on their website.</p><p>This commercial failure, combined with the failure of the big-budget <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9290\" href=\"/advent-rising/3030-9290/\">Advent Rising</a>, resulted in the near-bankruptcy of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-370\"

"<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The fearless Shovel Knight has no weapon aside from his trusty shovel which he uses to dig for treasure, lump boulders at enemies or safely jump on otherwise foes and across deadly chasms. On his quest to reach his nemesis, Shovel Knight must travel through woods and volcanoes, across the sea, over mountains, and through the sky in <a href=\"/airship/3055-154/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-154\">airships</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/yacht-club-games/3010-8654/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8654\">Yacht Club Games</a>' platforming adventure about a knight and his shovel reached its <a href=\"/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7378\">Kickstarter</a> funding goal halfway through its campaign on March 30, 2013. <a href=\"/jake-kaufman/3040-51915/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-51915\">Jake \"Virt\" Kaufman</a> is handling the majority of the music. During the the Kickstarter campaign, Yacht Club announced that original <a href=\"/mega-man/3030-5251/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5251\">Mega Man</a> composer <a href=\"/manami-matsumae/3040-53195/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-53195\">Manami Matsumae</a> would be contributing two songs to Shovel Knight. The Kickstarter campaign ended with pledges totaling US$311,502, well exceeding the original $75,000 goal and fulfilling all stretch goals. Yacht Club stated that stretch goal-features would probably be added to the game post-release via free updates.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Yacht Club Games first showed off the game to visitors at <a href=\"/pax-east-2013/3015-7348/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7348\">PAX East 2013.</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For the Japan release, the game is being published by Nintendo.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shovel Knight plays in a predominantly side-scrolling 2D style reminiscent of 8-bit games such as <a href=\"/mega-man-2/3030-14026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14026\">Mega Man 2</a>, <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3030-1653/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1653\">Ninja Gaiden</a> and <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Castlevania</a>. There are a few sections of the game where uninterrupted vertical scrolling is used for platforming challenges, but much of the game's verticality is limited to climbing and descending ladders to proceed to the next screen.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shovel Knight can jump fairly high in relation to his (somewhat short) stature. The player can catch ladders and control his direction in mid-air, and can achieve greater height with the downward thrust (described below). The game's level design is tailored to challenge the player's ability to navigate platforming challenges--bottomless pits, spiked floors, moving platforms, forced scrolling, and the like.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To defeat enemies, Shovel Knight has a melee attack in the form of a single shovel swipe which can only damage enemies to the left or right--he cannot strike upwards. He can also point his shovel downwards to attack enemies below him while jumping, and this maneuver serves a dual purpose in that a successful downward strike results in Shovel Knight propelling himself back up into the air (necessary for navigating certain level design challenges). This mimics the downward thrust mechanic of NES titles <a href=\"/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link/3030-16241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16241\">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a> and <a href=\"/ducktales/3030-15799/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15799\">Duck Tales</a>. The shovel can be used not only to defeat enemies, but also destroy certain blocks of terrain, deflect certain projectiles, and knock away bombs.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shovel Knight's melee attack can be upgraded, through purchases, to include a charged-up strike and a full-health projectile attack. His attack upgrades are permanent and stackable.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shovel Knight is not limited to his shovel for offense and defense, as he can purchase several relics throughout the course of the game. These relics require the use of magic points, and give him various projectile attacks to attack enemies above or below him; at a distance; and surrounding him. Also available for purchase are different suits of armor with varied effects--less recoil when taking damage; less magic consumed when using relics; et cetera. Unlike the weapon upgrades, armor cannot be stacked; the player can only enjoy one set of benefits at a time and must change between purchased suits in order to attain another. Max Health and Max Magic upgrades can also be purchased or found.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With all of the purchasing options out there, the game emphasizes the importance of obtaining and keeping money. There are piles of dirt everywhere that Shovel Knight can dig up, revealing jewels. Breakable walls and treasure chests also present themselves in various situations--obvious, secret, and out in the open but difficult to <em>get </em>to. Enemies also drop valuables. When losing all his health or falling into a pit, Shovel Knight loses a percentage of his money, but it remains around the area where he died for retrieval. Should he fail in retrieving his money before being defeated again, however, that specific allotment of money is lost forever.</p><h3>Structure</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shovel Knight's progression is a hybrid of <a href=\"/linear-gameplay/3015-383/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-383\">linear</a> and open styles. The world map--which stylistically resembles that of <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>--opens up one cluster at a time upon clearing out the previous cluster of stages, with each cluster making a few new stages plus some extra areas available. In this way, Shovel Knight guides and restricts the player to complete a few levels within a general difficulty range before being able to move on to a set of levels with greater difficulty. However, the player is still free to choose the order in which s/he tackles the levels within a given cluster.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Each level comes with a particular number of checkpoints, which play a pivotal role in the aforementioned money retrieval system. Shovel Knight can either activate or destroy a checkpoint as he comes across it; in the case of the former, death will send him back to that checkpoint so that the player (a) doesn't have to start at the beginning of the level to complete it and (b) is closer to his or her lost money for easier retrieval. In the case of the latter, where Shovel Knight destroys the checkpoint, the player is granted extra loot... but obviously, the trade-off is that s/he cannot return to that checkpoint if Shovel Knight bites the dust.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While each level does come with a bevy of secret passages and goodies, there is generally only one real path to get from the beginning to the end. Certain exceptions include pathways that may take Shovel Knight in an elevated area of the same passage, but all told, there are no wildly different routes present.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2458454\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56142857142857\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458454\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png 700w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2458454-5be3b96b0d880408253ead524df2b960_large.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The end of each level takes Shovel Knight to an encounter with one of the rival knights of The Order Of No Quarter. Each rival knight features vastly different attacks requiring a variety of tactics to overcome. Upon defeating every knight, the final road opens, allowing Shovel Knight to take on The Enchantress' castle.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In another nod to Super Mario Bros. 3, while on the world map, random enemy sprites will appear and threaten to collide with Shovel Knight. When this happens, the player will be thrust either into a <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">mini-boss</a> encounter or a special version of a level with the sole purpose being to collect more loot. There are also side areas that aren't full levels, but serve to test the player's skill with a newfound ability.</p><h2>Modes</h2><h3>New Game Plus</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">New game plus allows you to play through the game a second time with all the armor, abilities, gold and stats you have earned from the first play through. However, the mobs hit twice as hard, you have less check points per level and most of the food you find through the levels have been swapped with bombs. The other major change comes from the Tower. You no longer get a food refill after each boss. It has been replaced with food after defeating two bosses.</p><h3>Challenge Mode</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Challenge Mode will ask the player to complete a specific task such as defeating all enemies or collecting all gems.</p><h3>Gender Swap Mode</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A mode that swaps the genders of all major characters (Shovel Knight, The Enchantress, The Order of No Quarter) excluding enemies.</p><h3>Battle Mode</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">No specifics have been announced other than that it will be for up to four players and local play only.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Reception</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In its first month, Shovel Knight managed to sell 180,000 copies across all three initial platforms with PC sales being global and Wii U and 3DS being limited to North America only. As of December 2014, total sales reached 300,000 globally across all platforms, now also including Europe and Australia for Wii U and 3DS and additional releases on Mac and Linux.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/204143/2652214-5947808424-a3801.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652214\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/204143/2652214-5947808424-a3801.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652214\"><img alt=\"The Front Cover of the Shovel Knight Original Soundtrack.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/204143/2652214-5947808424-a3801.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/204143/2652214-5947808424-a3801.jpg 1200w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/204143/2652214-5947808424-a3801.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>The Front Cover of the Shovel Knight Original Soundtrack.</figcaption></figure><h3>Shovel Knight Original Soundtrack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Composer: </strong><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/jake-kaufman/3040-51915/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-51915\">Jake Kaufman</a></p><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Track#</th><th scope=\"col\">Title</th><th scope=\"col\">length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">1.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">2.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">3.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">4.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">5.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">6.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">7.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">8.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">9.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">10.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">11.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">12.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">13.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">14.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">15.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">16.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">17.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">18.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">19.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">20.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">21.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">22.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">23.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">24.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">25.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">26.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">27.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">28.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">29.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">30.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">31.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">32.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">33.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">34.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">35.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">36.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">37.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">38.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">39.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">40.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">41.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">42.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">43.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">44.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">45.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">46.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">47.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">48.</p></td><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Main Theme</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Steel Thy Shovel</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One Fateful Knight</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Strike the Earth (Plains of Passage)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Rival (Black Knight - First Battle)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For Shovelry!

His goal is to reach the end of each stage, traversing hazards and defeating enemies with his Mega Blaster (the default weapon, renamed Mega Buster in <a href=\"/mega-man-4/3030-8141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8141\">Mega Man 4</a>). The end boss of each stage is called a Robot Master, of which there are six.</p><p>Each of Dr. Wily's six reprogrammed robots, or <a href=\"/robot-masters/3015-154/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-154\">Robot Masters</a>, must be fought at the end of their own individual stages before the player can enter Wily's fortress. The player can tackle the stages in any order, and once a Robot Master is defeated, Mega Man will acquire a new weapon. Every weapon has its own energy meter (except the default Mega Blaster), which can individually be filled or depleted based on usage. Each of the Robot Masters is especially weak against a certain weapon used by a different Robot Master, giving the player a reason to tackle the stages in a specific order.</p><p>Each of the weapons have their unique abilities. One weapon for example (Guts Man's weapon) gives Mega Man the ability to pick up large blocks and toss them at enemies.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p><b>DRN-003:</b> <a href=\"/cut-man/3005-894//\" data-ref-id=\"3005-894\">Cut Man</a></p><p><i>\"Designed to function as a lumberjack.

Each Coin obtained slightly increases a kart's top speed up to a maximum of ten Coins; however, the player can continue collecting surplus Coins without further benefit to their maximum speed. Bumping into a competitor's kart causes players to lose one coin. Being hit by a competitor's item-based attack results in a loss of four Coins and causes the player's kart to spin-out. If a player has no Coins, any contact with another kart will result in a spin-out.

Arguably the origin of <a href=\"/machinima/3015-1276/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1276\">machinima</a>, the Quake engine would be used to create films such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blahbalicious\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blahbalicious</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seal_of_Nehahra\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Seal of Nehahra</a>, movies which often had little or nothing to do with the game itself. Quake multiplayer became one of the first competitive games to be treated as an <a href=\"/esports/3015-4796/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4796\">eSport</a>, with skilled players such as Dennis \"Thresh\" Fong and Johnathan \"Fatal1ty\" Wendel becoming gaming celebrities in Quake's limelight. <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">Speed running</a> site the <a href=\"http://speeddemosarchive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">speed demos archive</a> was created after the release of Quake. The engine would later be licensed for use in various other products, such as <a href=\"/hexen-ii/3030-15660/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15660\">Hexen II</a>, <a href=\"/x-men-the-ravages-of-apocalypse/3030-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4324\">X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse</a>, and <a href=\"/half-life/3030-2980/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2980\">Half-Life</a>, in addition to providing the foundation for the <a href=\"/quake-ii/3030-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3207\">Quake II</a> engine.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Though Quake is not a particularly story-driven game, the manual provides a basic setup for the events that transpire, which is noticeably similar to the backstory for the first <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a>. While developing <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleportation</a> devices known as slipgates, a covert organization, presumably under the jurisdiction of the US military, makes contact with a hostile extra-dimensional being, codenamed Quake. Quake begins using Earth's own technology against it, teleporting his death squads deep inside the human installations which house the slipgates, leading to untold carnage and destruction. Fearing that the situation will soon become untenable, a commander involved in the project contacts the protagonist of Quake, an unnamed though highly skilled operative.</p><p>Finding himself drafted into Operation Counterstrike, the protagonist is tasked with finding and stopping Quake by any means necessary. Not long thereafter, the installation is attacked, and the unknown soldier is left as the sole surviving member of Operation Counterstrike. He immediately resolves to seek out Quake on his own...</p><p>Very little narrative is provided in-game, save for a few congratulatory sentences when a player finishes an episode. After gathering the four runes necessary to unlock the game's final confrontation, Quake is revealed to be <a href=\"/shub-niggurath/3005-4402/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4402\">Shub-Niggurath</a>, a Lovecraftian elder god that exists as a massive faceless entity of flesh and writhing tentaces. The being is seemingly impervious to all damage, though the nameless soldier is able to defeat her by unorthodox means.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746352\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746352\"><img alt=\"Difficulty settings are chosen in-game.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/1746352-quakeintroduction.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Difficulty settings are chosen in-game.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> before it, Quake is a fast-paced FPS with a linear progression of levels broken up into episodes. The objective of each level is simply to reach the exit, killing anything dangerous along the way. There are numerous obstructions to slow the player's progress, such as traps and locked doors which must be bypassed using buttons, keycards or keys.</p><p>Despite these additional considerations, however, Quake is almost entirely focused upon \"run and gun\" first-person action. After each level, the player is presented with level statistics showing their total completion time as well as the number of enemies killed and secrets discovered compared to the maximum.</p><p>Quake's four episodes can be tackled in any order, though there is an intended sequence. At the beginning of each episode, the player starts with only the Shotgun and the Axe, and weapons collected in each episode are not carried over to the next. Once the player has completed all four episodes and gathered the four magical runes within them, the pathway to Shub-Niggurath and the final confrontation is opened.</p><h3>Single-Player Maps &amp; Authors</h3><ul><li>Start: <b>Introduction</b> by John Romero</li></ul><p><b>Episode 1: Dimension of the Doomed</b></p><p><i>The mystical past comes alive...</i></p><ul><li>E1M1: <b>The Slipgate Complex</b> by John Romero</li><li>E1M2: <b>Castle of the Damned</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E1M3: <b>The Necropolis</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E1M4: <b>The Grisly Grotto</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E1M5: <b>Gloom Keep</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E1M6: <b>The Door to Chthon</b> by American McGee</li><li>E1M7: <b>The House of Chthon</b> by American McGee</li><li>E1M8: <b>Ziggurat Vertigo*</b> by American McGee</li></ul><p><b>Episode 2: The Realm of Black Magic</b></p><p><i>Ancient castles and strange beasts ahead...</i></p><ul><li>E2M1: <b>The Installation</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M2: <b>The Ogre Citadel</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M3: <b>The Crypt of Decay</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M4: <b>The Ebon Fortress</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M5: <b>The Wizard's Manse</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M6: <b>The Dismal Oubliette</b> by John Romero</li><li>E2M7: <b>The Underearth*</b> by Tim Willits</li></ul><p><b>Episode 3: The Netherworld</b></p><p><i>Primal fear in a strange dimension...</i></p><ul><li>E3M1: <b>Termination Central</b> by John Romero</li><li>E3M2: <b>The Vaults of Zin</b> by American McGee</li><li>E3M3: <b>The Tomb of Terror</b> by American McGee</li><li>E3M4: <b>Satan's Dark Delight</b> by American McGee</li><li>E3M5: <b>The Wind Tunnels</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E3M6: <b>Chambers of Torment</b> by American McGee &amp; Tim Willits</li><li>E3M7: <b>The Haunted Halls*</b> by American McGee</li></ul><p><b>Episode 4: The Elder World</b></p><p><i>Your worst nightmares come true...</i></p><ul><li>E4M1: <b>The Sewage System</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>E4M2: <b>The Tower of Despair</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M3: <b>The Elder God Shrine</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M4: <b>The Palace of Hate</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M5: <b>Hell's Atrium</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M6: <b>The Pain Maze</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M7: <b>Azure Agony</b> by Sandy Petersen</li><li>E4M8: <b>The Nameless City*</b> by Sandy Petersen</li></ul><ul><li>End: <b>Shub-Niggurath's Pit</b> by John Romero</li></ul><p><i>* indicates a secret level.</i></p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Quake was one of the first games to include a client-server model for multiplayer, rather than a peer-to-peer model. <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">Deathmatch</a>, Team Deathmatch, and full <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">Cooperative</a> modes were included at release. Quake actually included two multiplayer clients, and was one of the first games to include TCP/IP-based multiplayer that worked over the Internet. Unfortunately, the client that shipped with the game wasn't optimized for the high-latency and low-bandwidth of the dial-up connections common to the time.</p><p>The original Quake engine is commonly refereed to as \"NetQuake\".</p><h3>QuakeWorld</h3><p>About six months after Quake was released, id Software released an update, dubbed QuakeWorld, which utilized the UDP protocol and moved many tasks that had previously run on the server side to the client. This allowed online games consisting of 32 or more players to take place between players on dialup with relatively low latency. Tournaments all over the world still include Quake in their playlists, but most first-person shooters have since moved away from the unyielding speed and lethality of the original Quake.</p><p>Quake has more realistic physics than Doom, but they are more vulnerable to abuse. Tactics such as <a href=\"/bunny-hopping/3015-254/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-254\">bunny hopping</a> and <a href=\"/rocket-jump/3015-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-20\">rocket jumping</a> originated in Quake multiplayer. Skilled players can abuse Quake's physics to move faster than normal, and obstacles can often be bypassed effortlessly. These physics have been implemented as a feature in some modern mods, including Fortress Forever and Garry's Mod.</p><h3>Deathmatch Maps &amp; Authors</h3><ul><li>DM1: <b>Place of Two Deaths</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>DM2: <b>Claustrophobopolis</b> by American McGee</li><li>DM3: <b>The Abandoned Base</b> by John Romero</li><li>DM4: <b>The Bad Place</b> by American McGee</li><li>DM5: <b>The Cistern</b> by Tim Willits</li><li>DM6: <b>The Dark Zone</b> by Tim Willits</li></ul><h4>Other maps</h4><p>Quake had an active mapping scene which spawned two maps that are widely regarded as some of the best competitive Quake has to offer. They are played in almost every QuakeWorld, <a href=\"/quake-iii-arena/3030-3874/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3874\">Quake III Arena</a> and <a href=\"/quake-live/3030-21388/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21388\">Quake Live</a> tournament and have been ported to several other Arena style FPS.</p><ul><li><strong>Aerowalk </strong>by Mattias \"Preacher\" Konradsson</li><li><strong>Blood run</strong> (ztndm3) by Sten \"ztn\" Uusvali</li></ul><h2>Modifications</h2><p>Like id Software's previous title, Doom, Quake had a very active <a href=\"/mods/3015-417/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-417\">modding </a>scene, which was supported by id with the release of SDK's, level editors and exhaustive information about the game's file system and the built-in scripting language QuakeC. These ranged from sound, model or texture replacements, additional levels, to total conversions, changing the core gameplay.</p><p>Some of the earliest mods were <strong>Quake Rally</strong>, which turned Quake into a racing game with rather detailed vehicle physics for the era, and <strong>AirQuake</strong>, turning it into a third person multiplayer dogfighting game, with a large selection of real world jets.</p><p><em>Other mods include:</em></p><ul><li>Painkeep (featuring new maps &amp; weapons, including exploding shells &amp; the chain lightening gun)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.runequake.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Runequake </a>(a serverside mod for multiplayer which gives players new abilities based on the runes they pick up)</li><li>Slide (a hoverboard racing game)</li><li>Kickflip Quake (a skateboarding game)</li><li>Giana Sisters (a 2D platformer based on a Mario ripoff)</li><li>Reaper Bot (Possibly the first bot ever made for a multiplayer FPS)</li></ul><h3>Team Fortress</h3><p>One of Quake's most popular mods was<a href=\"/team-fortress/3025-655/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-655\"> Team Fortress</a>, which was released in 1997 and turned it into a class, team and objective based multiplayer game. This spawned similar mods for other games and resulted in Valve acquiring the developers, having them create <a href=\"/team-fortress-classic/3030-4561/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4561\">Team Fortress Classic</a> for <a href=\"/half-life/3030-2980/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2980\">Half-life</a> and later <a href=\"/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18162\">Team Fortress 2</a>. The map <a href=\"/2-fort/3035-55/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-55\">2forts </a>has been one of the popular ever since the original mods release, and remains one of the most popular maps in Team Fortress 2.</p><h2>Speedrunning</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761318\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72142857142857\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761318\"><img alt=\"Speed Demos Archive, the largest provider of Quake speedrunning\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg 280w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Speed Demos Archive, the largest provider of Quake speedrunning\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1761318-1.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Speed Demos Archive, the largest provider of Quake speedrunning</figcaption></figure><p>The website <a href=\"http://speeddemosarchive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speed Demos Archive</a> is the headquarters of Quake speedruns and speedrunners alike. The website has an extremely large library of quake speedruns of all kinds, and it was formally exclusive to Quake speedruns before later expanding to other games. However, Quake speedrunning is still a big part of Speed Demos Archive and has its own massive section on the website. The section contains Quake speedrunning news as well as information on rules, contests, runners, contests, projects, and more.</p><p>The website also features a section called \"demos\" which contains all the quake speedruns. The main runs are split up into three main categories: any%, 100%, and cooperative. The runs themselves are split up into several sub-sections including id Levels, Hipnotic Levels, Rogue Levels, Custom Episodes, and Custom Levels. The first 3 sections are for official levels created by the developer and the last two are for user created levels. Within each section is a list of all the levels featured in that section. The Cooperative section has different sub-sections: Easy Runs, Easy 100%, Nightmare Runs, Nightmare 100%, and Mad Coops (3 player runs).</p><p>What is shown next to each level depends on the category. For example, in the \"Run\" (any%) category next to the levels name is the current easy any% record followed by the record holders name and next to that is the nightmare any% record followed by that record holders name. If the 100% section was chosen the any% best times would be replaced by the 100% best times. The Cooperative section works differently, if the \"Easy Run\" sub-section was chosen it shows record time for an easy 2 player coop run followed by the name of the runner. If Easy 100% was chosen it would be the same except the any% record time would be changed for the 100% coop record time and so on and so forth.</p><p>Clicking on the link for a level provides further information that includes record time progression for easy any% run, easy 100% time, nightmare any% run, and nightmare 100% run in that order. Single player runs are shown first followed by multiplayer runs. The multiplayer runs can range from anywhere from 2 to 7 players, some levels have multiple multiplayer runs while others have none.</p><p>There is a special fourth category titled \"Marathon Demos\". This section features single segment runs of whole episodes or the entire game/expansion pack. These runs are also have seperate categories for easy any%, easy 100%, Nightmare any%, and Nightmare 100%. In addition to this, the section also has cooperative runs and record time progression.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>The weapons of Quake are a pretty straightforward affair, consisting almost entirely of point-and-shoot armaments with no alternate firing modes. In fact, the Grenade Launcher is the only ranged weapon in Quake that does not travel in a straight path toward its target. Despite this simplicity, or perhaps because of it, the Quake arsenal has become quite iconic, and the Rocket Launcher in particular is an object of affection for many Quake fans.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1745326\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1745326\"><img alt=\"Axe\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Axe\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/1745326-quakeaxe.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Axe</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3><a href=\"/axe/3055-437/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-437\">Axe</a></h3> One of Quake's two starting weapons, the Axe is the only melee weapon available, and is generally cannot be recommended unless there are no alternatives.

MGS2 does not star the former <a href=\"/foxhound/3015-447/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND</a> agent <a href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake</a>. Instead, <a href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima</a> took players into the mind of super soldier <a href=\"/raiden/3005-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-347\">Raiden</a>, a <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> operative on his first live combat scenario. His objective is to stop a group of terrorists, calling themselves the Sons of Liberty. This includes blowing up a large oil cleanup facility and killing the President of the United States.</p><p>MGS2's innovations included its introduction of the <a href=\"/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sight</a> mechanic for more accurate aiming, and a refined <a href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover system</a> that allowed both players and enemies to shoot from cover. It also introduced collective enemy <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">AI </a>routines that relied on squad tactics rather than working individually, while individual enemies expressed fear and even birds had their own AI routines. MGS2 was considered to have the best enemy AI in gaming for many years. The physics was also a major step forward for gaming, particularly the sophisticated <a href=\"/particle-system/3015-4608/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4608\">particle </a>effects for its time (including for individual drops of <a href=\"/rain/3015-3077/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3077\">rain</a>) and the way objects moved.</p><p>The game earned both critical and commercial acclaim upon release, with the highest sales and review scores in the series. However, the game's convoluted story, excessive use of <a href=\"/codec/3015-2355/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2355\">Codec</a> conversations and new protagonist Raiden was criticized by a number of fans, temporarily relegating him to a joke character (even with Kojima himself) until his popular transformation in <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\">Metal Gear Solid 4</a>.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding the unexpected <a href=\"/false-protagonist/3015-3328/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3328\">bait-and-switch</a> and convoluted storyline at the time, Sons of Liberty is today seen as a landmark title in the history of video games. It is considered the first truly postmodern video game, is frequently cited as a primary example of artistic expression in video games, and is generally considered one of the most influential games of the past decade, both for its artistic influence on later video game storylines (most notably <a href=\"/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/3030-7512/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness</a>, <a href=\"/killer7/3030-18347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18347\">Killer7</a>, <a href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\">Portal</a>, and especially <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a>, which even featured a very similar plot twist) as well as its influence on the gameplay mechanics of many action games since.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty does not star <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid/3030-16140/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">MGS</a> hero, <a href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake</a>, but instead a new character codenamed <a href=\"/raiden/3005-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-347\">Raiden</a>. Raiden himself received a lot of flak because gamers complained he was too whiny and effeminate. Additionally the game was touted as being far too convoluted by some, especially in its ending, and many elements of sci-fi and fantasy such as <a href=\"/vampire/3015-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-117\">vampires</a> and other immortal beings were introduced that didn't mesh well with some of the Metal Gear Solid community at the time. Other issues that raised controversy at the time was the game's exploration of taboos such as incest and sexual orientation, and the plot's blurring of the line between fantasy and reality (which was in fact one of the game's stated goals in Hideo Kojima's original design document).</p><p>Despite being controversial at the time, Metal Gear Solid 2 has over the years become accepted as the first truly postmodern video game and is often cited a primary example of artistic expression in video games. It deals with many social, philosophical and <a href=\"/cyberpunk/3015-6735/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6735\">post-cyberpunk</a> themes in great detail, including <a href=\"/meme-origin/3015-2420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2420\">meme</a> theory, misinformation, propaganda, social engineering, sociology, <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">artificial intelligence</a>, information control, <a href=\"/conspiracy/3015-2664/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2664\">conspiracy</a> theories, political and military maneuvering, <a href=\"/evolution/3015-1140/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1140\">evolution</a>, existentialism, censorship, the manipulation of free will, the nature of reality, child exploitation, and taboos such as <a href=\"/incest/3015-2829/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2829\">incest</a> and <a href=\"/lgbt/3015-2087/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2087\">sexual orientation</a>. The game is also often cited as an example of <a href=\"/metafictional/3015-6438/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6438\">metafiction</a>, in how Hideo Kojima\u2019s imposed plan/path for both Raiden and the player maps to the manipulative nature of the government.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326297\" data-ratio=\"0.76923076923077\" data-width=\"780\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 780px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1326297\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg 780w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3194/1326297-metalgearray.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The game opens with Snake as the main character in the prologue mission. Snake and <a href=\"/otacon/3005-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Otacon</a> have formed their own non-profit organization called Philanthropy between MGS1 and MGS2; the purpose of this organization is to find and hunt <a href=\"/metal-gear/3055-28/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gears</a>. Between the two games, <a href=\"/revolver-ocelot/3005-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Revolver Ocelot</a> has recovered the plans for <a href=\"/metal-gear-rex/3055-3542/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3542\">Metal Gear REX</a> and leaked them on the internet. As a result the world has gone Metal Gear crazy and new varieties of them are being produced. Snake, on this mission, is sent to take <a href=\"/photography/3015-369/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-369\">photographs</a> of a new Metal Gear called <a href=\"/metal-gear-ray/3055-3540/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3540\">Metal Gear RAY</a>. This one was developed by the U.S. Navy thus it is aquatic and this mission takes place on a large freighter. The boat is hijacked by <a href=\"/russia/3035-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russian</a> terrorists led in part by Ocelot. Upon reaching where Metal Gear RAY is being held, Snake takes the photographs he came for. However, Ocelot then reveals himself and hijacks RAY whilst under the control of Liquid Snake (Ocelot having taken Liquid's arm after his was cut off by the <a href=\"/gray-fox/3005-901/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Cyborg Ninja</a> in MGS1). Liquid Ocelot escapes with Metal Gear Ray after sinking the tanker,and Snake is presumed dead.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262999\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.55927051671733\" data-width=\"658\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 658px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262999\"><img alt=\"Solid Snake as Iroquois Pliskin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 658w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Solid Snake as Iroquois Pliskin\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 658w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/262999-00055385.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Solid Snake as Iroquois Pliskin</figcaption></figure><p>The game's true mission opens with our new hero Raiden infiltrating the <a href=\"/big-shell/3035-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-329\">Big Shell</a> research facility. The president has been taken hostage by a group of terrorists known as <a href=\"/dead-cell/3015-3703/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3703\">Dead Cell</a>, and are also threatening to launch a nuclear weapon, if demands aren't met. The leader of the operation is the third clone of <a href=\"/big-boss/3005-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss</a>, named <a href=\"/solidus-snake/3005-909/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-909\">Solidus Snake</a>. Throughout the game Raiden must confront members of Dead Cell, which features an immortal psychic armed with a Ray Gun named <a href=\"/fortune/3005-2454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2454\">Fortune</a>, a mad bomber aptly named <a href=\"/fatman/3005-2216/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2216\">Fatman</a> who has planted bombs all over the Shell, and a man who appears to be a vampire, conveniently named <a href=\"/vamp/3005-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-945\">Vamp</a>. It turns out that Snake has also come along for the ride, disguised as a <a href=\"/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2241\">Marine</a> by the name of Iroquois Pliskin. While you don't play as Snake he does provide key support and advice, along with Otacon, to Raiden during the mission.</p><p>The first thing Raiden must do, if he stands a chance of finding the President, is disarming the numerous bombs Fatman has planted on each of the Struts, and he does so with the help of Snake, and a bomb specialist by the name of Peter Stillman. Stillman happens to be the mentor of Fatman, and is killed by one of Fatman's bombs, which submerges parts of the shell. After Fatman's defeat Raiden encounters a mysterious Ninja, who first introduces itself as Deep Throat, but then changes that to Mr. X. Mr. X tells Raiden to find a man named Ames, in the B1 core, as this man knows the location of the President. Mr. X does not know what Ames looks like, but does know that Ames has a pacemaker.</p><p>Raiden, armed with a Guard's Uniform and AK-47, and a Directional Mic, infiltrates the Core and finds Ames - amongst a large number of other hostages. Ames confirms to Raiden that the Big Shell is indeed a cover up for the development for a new Metal Gear project. Raiden is discovered by Revolver Ocelot, and the stress causes Ames to die of a heart attack. Ocelot is about to kill Raiden but Mr. X appears and distracts Ocelot, allowing for Raiden's escape. Raiden is the confronted by a Harrier Jet, piloted by Vamp and Solidus.</p><p>Raiden finds his way to the President and learns several important things; firstly, Big Shell is actually a giant Metal Gear called Arsenal Gear. Secondly, Arsenal Gear houses a powerful super computer called GW which is responsible for controlling and organizing all information we humans are aware of in the digital age. Lastly, the president informs Raiden that the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> is in fact run by a small organization of people called <a href=\"/the-patriots/3005-4583/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4583\">The Patriots</a>. Raiden and Snake recover Otacon's sister, <a href=\"/emma-emmerich/3005-1870/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1870\">Emma</a> and install a virus to destroy GW but not before Emma is killed by Vamp. The destroying of GW causes <a href=\"/colonel-roy-campbell/3005-839/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Colonel Campbell</a> to constantly call Raiden and speak irrelevant phrases and state things irrelevant to the mission, often not making any sense at all. This also causes Colonel Campbell's face to appear disfigured and buggy over the Codec. The reason for this is that the Colonel Campbell we have been talking to throughout the game is actually a creation by GW from bits of information gathered about the real Campbell and what Raiden himself expected the Colonel to be like.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182637\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182637\"><img alt=\"Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3727/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.</figcaption></figure><p>A number of intense action sequences shortly follow with Raiden fighting off 25 Metal Gear RAYs alone on top of Arsenal Gear. He then confronts Solidus, who was a twisted father figure of sorts for him, in a climactic battle on the roof of Federal Hall. Raiden learns that The Patriots were attempting to control what kind of information is kept and what is left behind on the internet in an attempt to make future historians see a history that The Patriots want them to see. The Patriots also reveal that the entire Big Shell Incident was an elaborate scheme of theirs to make Raiden into a soldier who was equally as skilled as Solid Snake. This new Snake would be forged in battle (as opposed to using <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions/3030-8761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8761\">VR Training</a>), which explains how the events of this game were at their core so similar to those of the first Metal Gear Solid.

MGS2 introduced a host of new gameplay mechanics that would become staples of 3D action games for years to come.</p><p>Like its predecessor, players once again try to sneak by enemy guards, avoid being seen on <a href=\"/camera/3055-247/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-247\">cameras</a>, and fight ridiculous <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>. Players still viewed the action from a <a href=\"/top-down-perspective/3015-788/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down perspective</a> for much of the game, but the camera would occasionally switch to more cinematic perspectives during many key moments of the game.</p><p>The game introduced a number of new game mechanics and features, which included dead bodies that don't disappear and need to be hidden away from other guards, enemies being able to detect the player's shadows, the player being able to take out lights in an area to affect the enemy's vision, and realistic enemy artificial intelligence that relies on squad tactics rather than working individually. A major innovation to the gameplay was the introduction of multi-level environments that add an element of three-dimensional \"vertical tension\" to the stealth gameplay, which was previously limited to level surfaces in earlier titles. This gave the player many new options on how to approach a situation, which included being able to attack or perform various actions from above ceilings, from underwater, or from underneath floors.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238466\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238466\"><img alt=\"  \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg 400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"  \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg 400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/238466-raiden23.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>  </figcaption></figure><p>Another very important innovation in MGS2 was the game's shooting mechanic. In the original game, Snake had to fire at enemies from the same top-down view. The perspective was optimal for sneaking, but cumbersome in a situation that required accurate shooting. MGS2 added the ability to fire weapons from a <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person perspective</a>. Snake could still shoot without entering First-Person, but holding down the fire button while in a First Person View mode would cause Snake to raise his gun up, allowing him to aim using the weapon's <a href=\"/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sight</a>. The game utilized the Dualshock 2's pressure sensitive buttons in that applying various amounts of pressure would allow the player to aim the weapon without actually firing it or putting down the weapon without firing it. The first-person firing added much greater depth to the shooting mechanics of the previous game, by allowing true three-dimensional aiming, whether at different parts of the enemy's body, at various different objects, or at different areas of the game's new multi-level environments.</p><p>MGS2 also provided players with a number of options should sneaking be the optimal course of action. Most obviously, Raiden came into combat with a silenced, one-shot <a href=\"/tranquilizer/3055-853/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-853\">tranquilizer</a> <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, which could knock opponents unconscious (faster or slower depending on where they were hit). Bodies could now be stored in lockers to keep them out of sight from other guards. Raiden could, like snake, press up against walls and peak down hallways, but MGS2 provided Raiden the ability to pop out into the hallway and fire shots. Raiden could also move much more slowly and quietly than Snake, keeping him moving without being heard by guards.</p><p>The game also introduced a <a href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover system</a>, with Solid Snake or Raiden now able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player character. The enemies would often take cover to call for backup, but during battle, they would take cover then pop out and shoot at the player or blindly throw grenades from behind their cover. MGS2's cover system would later be refined by <a href=\"/killswitch/3030-1152/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1152\">Kill Switch</a> and popularized by <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>. MGS2 also introduced an innovative <a href=\"/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sight</a> mechanic, where a laser sight helps assist with manually aiming a gun, which would later be widely adopted by third-person shooters such as <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a> and Gears of War.</p><h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263017\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74545454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263017\"><img alt=\"  \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 550w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"  \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 550w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6664/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>  </figcaption></figure><p>MGS2 offered significant upgrades to the guard routines featured in <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid/3030-16140/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid</a> for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>. Similar to how guards could become suspicious when seeing footprints in the snow in the original, MGS2's guards will notice noises made by the player, hence Raiden's new ability to walk slowly and silently. Other new additions to the enemy AI include being able to detect the player's shadows, being able to hear the player sneezing from a cold, the player being able to take out lights in an area to affect the enemy's vision, and the enemies even being able to <a href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">take cover</a> from the player (an innovation that wouldn't become popular until many years later).</p><p>The most important innovation to the enemy artificial intelligence was the introduction of a collective intelligence that relied on squad tactics, in contrast to previous games where guards only worked individually. This time in MGS2, guards would call on their radios for a strike team upon seeing the player, then attempt to flank him and cut off his escape while avoiding the player's attacks. Often strike teams will carry body armor and riot shields, making them an even greater threat. Even if the player escapes to a hiding place, a team will sweep in to check the area. The game has a collective enemy AI, where enemy guards work together in squads, can communicate with one another, and react in a more realistic manner towards the player. The game's enemy AI was considered one of the best in gaming for many years.</p><p>Guards who spotted Raiden would automatically radio for additional units to combat the player. Avoiding the guards in their alert phase (by hiding in lockers, under tables, etc.) would trigger the guard's caution phase. Guards won't be actively pursuing Raiden, but will be much more alert in this phase, searching rooms and lockers, and constantly radioing back to headquarters. If the player stays for too long in the alert phase, additional, stronger units (armed with better weapons and shields) will try to overwhelm Raiden.</p><p>Players with a steady aim can stop a guard from calling for more units by quickly shooting his <a href=\"/walkie-talkie/3055-631/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-631\">walkie-talkie</a> before he has time to use it. If the guard starts requesting for backup and the player then shoots the walkie-talkie, HQ will become suspicious and send reinforcements either way. If the player shoots the walkie-talkie before the request for backup, the guard will run to the nearest exit from the level and request backup from there.</p><h3>Bosses</h3><p>- <a href=\"/olga-gurlukovich/3005-2672/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2672\">Olga Gurlukovich</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120976\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.372\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120976\"><img alt=\"Fatman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fatman\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1120976-fatman1.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fatman</figcaption></figure><p>- Gurlukovich Soldiers</p><p>- <a href=\"/fortune/3005-2454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2454\">Fortune</a></p><p>- <a href=\"/fatman/3005-2216/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2216\">Fatman</a></p><p>- The <a href=\"/harrier-vstol-jump-jet/3055-4714/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4714\">Harrier</a></p><p>- <a href=\"/vamp/3005-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-945\">Vamp</a></p><p>- Arsenal Tengu</p><p>- <a href=\"/metal-gear-ray/3055-3540/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3540\">Metal Gear Ray</a> Units (mass produced)</p><p>- <a href=\"/solidus-snake/3005-909/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-909\">Solidus Snake</a></p><h2>Soundtracks</h2><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Original Soundtrack</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504687\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"1.0066666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504687\"><img alt=\"MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/504687-mgs2ost.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Metal Gear Solid Main Theme</li><li>Opening Infiltration</li><li>Russian Soldiers from Kasatka</li><li>Olga Gurlukovich</li><li>Metal Gear</li><li>Revolver Ocelot</li><li>RAY Escapes</li><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Piano Version)</li><li>Big Shell</li><li>Fortune</li><li>Kill Me Now!</li><li>Vamp</li><li>The World Needs Only One Big Boss</li><li>It's the Harrier!</li><li>Arsenal is Going to Take Off</li><li>Who Am I Really?</li><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Full Version)</li></ol><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: The Other Side</h3><ol><li>Tanker Incident</li><li>The Elevator Up To Hell</li><li>Vamp's Dance</li><li>Infiltration</li><li>Battle</li><li>Peter's Theme</li><li>Countdown To Disaster</li><li>Lady Luck Revisited</li><li>Yell \"Dead Cell\"</li><li>Metal Gear's Already Active</li><li>Arms Depot</li><li>Memories of Hal</li><li>Twilight Sniping</li><li>Will the Virus Still Work</li><li>Comradeship</li><li>Reminiscence</li><li>Arsenal's Guts</li><li>Prelude to the Denouement</li><li>Father and Son</li><li>Freedom to Decide</li></ol><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</h3><ol><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Mix)</li><li>Opening Infiltration A (Original Mix)</li><li>Opening Infiltration B (Original Mix)</li><li>Revolver Ocelot (Original Mix)</li><li>Arsenal is Going to Take Off!

The game is split up into a series of missions in which the player must complete one objective to finish, for example get to this location. The game takes place on a castle where Dante must confront demonic enemy bosses. The gameplay is broken up into two sections, <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee</a> combat and shooting. Melee combat sees Dante fighting with huge swords and demonic weapons. While fighting, the players style is graded depending on how quickly they can attack and how they avoid enemy attacks, the grades are D, C, B, A and S.</p><p>At the end of the mission the style is averaged and the player is awarded with a grade for that level. The shooting combat in the game is largely used to tie attacks together like combos, a way to keep your grade going whilst being far away from enemies. Whilst in combat Dante builds up his Devil Trigger ability which when activated allows the player to regenerate health and have increased attack power until the gauge runs out. The player is also able to equip a large number of weapons and guns which are suited to different combat styles.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Dante</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/262845-art01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262845\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3054830287206\" data-width=\"383\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 383px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/262845-art01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262845\"><img alt=\"  \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/262845-art01.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12482/262845-art01.jpg 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" data-width=\"490\"></a><figcaption>  </figcaption></figure><p>Dante is a freelance underground mercenary in modern America.

Whilst she is impressed with his fighting skills he explains that he hunts demons in pursuit of the ones who killed his mother and brother. After Trish explains the attack was a test she tells Dante that the demon he holds responsible for the deaths in his family is making a return. The pair then travel to an immense castle and Trish leaves Dante on his own to figure out what to do next. On his exploration Dante comes across large amounts of stock demons attempting to stop him on his quest. After further exploration and combat, Dante battles a demon named <a href=\"/nelo-angelo/3005-4520/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4520\">Nelo Angelo</a> who impresses Dante with his confidence and fighting ability. The demon however flees at the sight of Dante's half amulet, after the demon attacks later in the game it is revealed that the demon was infact Dante's twin brother <a href=\"/vergil/3005-1804/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1804\">Vergil</a> under demonic control.</p><p>When Dante finally meets back up with Trish, Dante finds out that she has betrayed him and she has been working for Mundus the whole time. When Trish is in danger Dante chooses to save her because of the resemblence she has to his mother. When finally confronting Mundus a wounded Trish helps Dante unleash his full power allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. After Mundus' defeat Dante and Trish escape the island in a plane and become partners in their new shop Devil Never Cry.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Devil May Cry began life as an early version of <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>. However, during early evaluations, it was determined that the game was too action-oriented rather than survival horror. While development of Resident Evil 4 restarted, it was decided to allow the previous work in progress to become its own game, resulting in DMC. Devil May Cry retains a number of elements from its days as a Resident Evil title, including its fixed camera angles, the puzzle-laden nature of the castle environment, and certain menu design elements.</li><li>The \"juggling\" that Dante can perform in the game comes from a bug discovered in a play test of <a href=\"/onimusha-warlords/3030-9088/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9088\">Onimusha: Warlords</a>.</li><li>The environments are based off the Spanish castles that developer Hideki Kamiya and his team visited during a research trip for Resident Evil 4.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3>Disc One</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430556\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430556\"><img alt=\"Official Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Official Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3769/2430556-devil%2Bmay%2Bcry%2Banime%2Boriginal%2Bsoundtrack%2Bdevil_may_cry_front.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Official Soundtrack cover art</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Let's Rock!

Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p>By default Zero utilises the notorious '<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/tank-controls/3015-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls</a>' as players move via a third-person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the player's view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. Simultaneously hitting down and the 'run' button will have the player character do a 180 degree turn, as is custom with Resident Evil games since <a href=\"/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>.</p><p>The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Cooperative Functions</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756624\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756624\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756624-552c7b8c215efe3bff1609c84aa050e8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Zero's one primary component that separates it from previous games of the series is its two-protagonist setup--being Rebecca Chambers &amp; Billy Coen--each of whom can be controlled by the player. When controlling one the other will follow closely by default and will attack any encroaching enemies - though it will use up any ammo it has access to in the process. It will also fire alongside the player at whatever enemy they're targeted at, though its frequency of attack is rather slow. Such behaviour related to its attacking and following procedures can be turned off, so it will merely follow the player without engaging in combat and/or will wait on the spot. When travelling together the player can control the movement of the alternate character as well with the c-stick/right analogue stick (default GameCube/PlayStation &amp; Xbox controls), though the secondary character will only run via this method and cannot walk.</p><p>Rather than having both characters following one another, players can also split them up. When split up the secondary character will await in the area they're left in until the player takes control, though they're still vulnerable to attack should there be any nearby enemies. If the secondary character is being attacked then the player will receive a warning over their radio; if players don't switch to the alternate character to save them, there's a high chance they may perish. This function is forced upon the player so as to solve certain puzzles, such as by having one character access an area that only he/she can travel to, while the other sends key items and/or supplies via a dumbwaiter.</p><p>While the majority of the game plays out with these mechanics in play, there are two occasions where the characters are separated without the ability to switch between the two for the sake of the story. One sequence forces players to play as Billy, while another, much longer segment has players play as Rebecca on her own.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p>Both Rebecca and Billy each have their own strengths and weaknesses to help distinguish the two. Due to his experience in the marines, Billy is significantly more durable than Rebecca and can withstand more damage before dying. His strength also allows him to interact with certain objects that Rebecca cannot, though the opposite is also true for Rebecca who can access certain areas that Billy cannot due to her smaller size.</p><p>Though Rebecca can't withstand nearly as much punishment as Billy, she is the only one of the two who can mix herbs, making Billy quite literally the only playable characters in the series who cannot mix herbs together. Her medicine case that she uses to mix herbs is also used for mixing certain chemicals to solve puzzles.</p><p>All weapons in the game can be used by both characters largely to the same effect.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768250\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768250\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768250-img-37.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The inventory system for Zero received a slight overhaul from previous games. Each of the two characters has their own six-slot inventory, to which they can trade items between each other at will so long as they're in the same room. However there are no <a href=\"/item-box/3055-6126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes</a> to be found in the game. Instead players can opt to drop items onto the ground, to which will persist there until/if it is collected. Any dropped items will also show up on the map.</p><p>Each character has their own personal item that's housed in a separate inventory slot - no other items can be exchanged into this slot. Rebecca has her medicine case, while Billy has a lighter.</p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><p>Most items and weapons take up a single inventory slot, however there are a select few that require two to carry. These are:</p><ul><li>Hunting Gun</li><li>Shotgun</li><li>Grenade Launcher</li><li>Hookshot</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p>A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p>Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/medical-herb/3055-566/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. Though as mentioned before only Rebecca can mix herbs. <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-spray/3055-619/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Zero requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory. However whereas Save Rooms would always be devoid of enemies in previous games, this isn't the case for Zero.</p><p> </p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4>Rebecca Chambers</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2757999\" data-ratio=\"2.24125\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:224.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2757999\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 800w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 428w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 285w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 800w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 428w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2757999----render2---a3uch.jpg 285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" data-width=\"285\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The youngest member of STARS at only eighteen and one of two protagonists, Rebecca serves as the medic for Bravo team.

The S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team is dispatched to the <a href=\"/arklay-mountains/3035-387/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-387\">Arklay Mountains</a> to investigate and find the cause of the murders that have recently occurred. While over the forest the Bravo team's helicopter is mysteriously forced to crash land. Upon leaving the crash site, the Bravo team discovers an overturned Military Police vehicle, as well as orders for the transport of a prisoner to be executed.</p><p>Rookie team medic <a href=\"/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1306\">Rebecca Chambers</a> discovers the Ecliptic Express stopped and without power in the middle of the forest. Upon entering the train, Rebecca encounters numerous zombies, and infected canine. Pressing further throughout the train, Rebecca meet <a href=\"/billy-coen/3005-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3137\">Billy Coen</a>, the prisoner that was being transported to his execution. With little control over the recent events, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to team up with Billy, to get to safer ground, still vowing to bring him into custody if they both make it out alive. Further exploring Billy and Rebecca meet what appears to be a possible survivor, but before getting too close they find out it is a humanoid leech. Billy disposes of the leech creature, afterwords they see a lone man outside of the train standing on a cliff who appears to have some sort of control over the leeches. Unable to identify the mysterious individual, they must find a way to restore power to the train and get out of the forest. Once, power is finally returned to the locomotive, the train speeds to an unknown destination and eventually derails.</p><p>Seemingly unscathed from the train crash Rebecca and Billy end up at the trains destination. The mansion like building, is actually revealed to be a training facility for new employees of the <a href=\"/umbrella-corporation/3015-204/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella Corporation</a>, and upon entering they are welcomed with a pre-recorded message from the head of the facility, <a href=\"/james-marcus/3005-4575/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4575\">James Marcus</a>. During their trek through the training facility the pair is face with numerous zombies as well as plenty of new abominations. Over the course of their time together, Rebecca begins to see that Billy isn't a quite the criminal type, and begins to wonder why he was sentenced to be executed. The two eventually discover an underground portion of the training facility and are separated when the floor that Rebecca is standing on collapses. After being rescued by Billy, she questions him about what he did to get the sentence he had been handed. Billy finally explains, that he was part of the <a href=\"/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2241\">USMC</a> (United States Marine Corps) and during a mission in Africa, his commanding officer ordered them to exterminate civilians of an African village that was suffering from a civil war. Billy refused to follow the orders, and once the information proved to be false, the slaughter was blamed entirely on him.</p><p>Upon entering an abandoned sewage treatment plant, the duo encounter James Marcus. Marcus, had been monitoring Coen and Chamber's progress throughout the training facility as well as the other areas they visited. Marcus reveals that a decade ago <a href=\"/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10018\">Lord Ozwell E. Spencer</a> has Marcus assassinated, in the midst of the research on his leech research. He explains that the Queen leech from his experiments crawled into his mouth after he was shot, and the T-Virus that the leech was injected with was able to resurrect Marcus. Midway through his speech, the Queen leech takes over Marcus' body, and causes him to mutate into a new type of leech monstrosity. After toppling the Queen leech, Rebecca and Billy escape the training facility just as it is rocked by a gigantic explosion. After the escape, Rebecca takes Billy's dog tags as \"proof\" that he didn't survive the incident, and then the pair amicably part ways. In the distance Rebecca is able to see the <a href=\"/spencer-mansion/3035-563/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-563\">Spencer mansion</a>.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Knife</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2819453\" data-ratio=\"0.75185185185185\" data-width=\"270\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 270px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2819453\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-width=\"270\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg 270w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2819453-chris_redfield_knife_2_by_james_miller-d2yemoq.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-width=\"270\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers, especially due to the typically claustrophobic environments. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p>Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768794\" data-ratio=\"1.6523297491039\" data-width=\"279\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:165.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768794\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" data-width=\"279\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png 279w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768794-re0cerberus.png 279w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" data-width=\"279\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil Zero are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p>Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Rebecca and Billy are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><p>Unlike other games in the series, there are only four dogs the player will encounter throughout the game, all of which are located in the beginning Ecliptic Express section.</p><h3>Crows</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768795\" data-ratio=\"1.0733944954128\" data-width=\"327\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 327px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768795\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg 327w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg 327w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2768795-crowre0_0.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As always, crows prove to be more of a nuisance than a genuine threat.

Always encountered in groups, they can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming.</p><p>Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.</p><h3>Eliminator</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2818508\" data-ratio=\"0.9180790960452\" data-width=\"708\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 708px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2818508\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png 708w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.png 708w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818508-re0_eliminators.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Eliminators are an infected breed of monkeys that are exceptionally fast and agile, somewhat akin to Hunters. However they are also rather small to boot, so should they happen to get close enough the player must then aim downwards to get a shot. Their main two attacks are to rapidly slash at the player when close, and to leap through the air and slash from afar. They are still vulnerable amidst their leaping animation, however, providing the player with an opportunity to show them down if they can react fast enough. Eliminators are rarely encountered alone, and if a group of two to three swarms the player they can prove to be highly difficult to escape without taking damage.</p><p>Despite their small size they're still rather sturdy. The handgun is outright useless--that is besides to potentially finish them off after already being weakened--as they shrug the bullets off completely and will continue their advance. As such the shotgun and grenade launcher are the most suitable.</p><h3>Hunter Alpha</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2818509\" data-ratio=\"1.4336283185841\" data-width=\"565\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2818509\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg 565w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg 565w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2818509-hunter.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The green Alpha variant of the Hunter makes another reprisal to the series, though they're not quite as prominent as they are in the original Resident Evil and its remake.

</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><h3>Costumes</h3><p>A single completion of the game will award players with some new costumes. Billy gains one, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/images/1300-2768253/\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768253\">being an Italian suit w/ shades</a>, while Rebecca gains two. One is a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/images/1300-2768255/\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768255\">cowgirl outfit</a>, to which she also wears in the Resident Evil remake should Chris happen to be wearing an alternate outfit, and the other is an <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/images/1300-2768254/\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2768254\">outfit comprised of a leather tube top and pants</a>.</p><h3>Leech Hunter</h3><p>Much like previous instalments in the series, Resident Evil Zero features its own unlockable minigame. The concept is that Billy and Rebecca must collect a certain amount of color-coded, leech-themed jewellery pieces before exiting out the Umbrella Research Facility front door. When collecting leeches it can only be done specifically for each character, blue for Billy and green for Rebecca, but they cannot swap using the exchange system or pick up the opposite color for their team mate. The unlockable costumes as noted above are available to wear in Leech Hunter as well.</p><p>There are a number of unlockable rewards available for the main game, which are unlocked depending on how many leech pieces the player collects upon exiting the facility. If one of the character dies then the player's progress is forfeited. A list of the rewards is as such:</p><ul><li><strong>0-29</strong> - Submachine gun ammo.</li><li><strong>30-59</strong> - Infinite handgun ammunition.</li><li><strong>60-89</strong> - Infinite Hunting Gun ammunition.</li><li><strong>90-99</strong> - Magnum Revolver is added for collection in Second Class Private Room B.</li><li><strong>100</strong> - Infinite ammunition for all weapons.</li></ul><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756620\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756620\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2756620-0e798a16a73b97bdd754714dc33f802f.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Following the success of the <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-27715/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27715\">Resident Evil</a> remake remastering, a similar such remastering was announced for Resident Evil Zero on May 26th, 2015 for an early 2016 release.

In it Billy Coen is replaced by notorious series antagonist Albert Wesker, depicted in his <a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5</a> attire. Rebecca is still in tow as a fellow protagonist, now wearing a new, darker outfit as well as the same type of jewel that allowed Wesker to brainwash <a href=\"/jill-valentine/3005-626/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-626\">Jill Valentine</a> into doing his bidding for him in Resident Evil 5. While D.C. Douglas returns to provide a few new lines of dialogue for telling Rebecca to follow or wait, all of the cutscenes instead simply feature Billy's dialogue coming out of Wesker.</p><p>Though mechanically speaking Wesker is more than just a simple character skin and has access to two unique abilities. First is a super-sprint, to which he can use to effortlessly rush past enemies, and the second is a kind of eye blast. The eye blast can be charged up for extra power, though even when at its lowest charge can make all of the zombies' heads within the vicinity explode. Rebecca does not gain any new abilities of her own, however, and neither character can change into any alternate outfits for this mode.</p><p>Wesker mode is played within the Normal setting.</p><h3>DLC Costumes</h3><p>RE0's Remastered version contains a number of new purchasable costumes for players to wear in the game. Two of which were given for free for preordering the game, while another two were awarded for preordering for <a href=\"/resident-evil-origins-collection/3030-50713/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50713\">Resident Evil: Origins Collection</a>. All costumes can be bought together as a bundle, however this is the only means by which to purchase the preorder outfits, which aren't sold separately.</p><p>None of the new costumes are originally designed for RE0, and instead originate across a number of classic Capcom games and Resident Evil game ports.

Development of Resident Evil Zero began in the Summer of 1998.</p><p>Much of what was developed for the prototype persists in the full retail release, such as the two-protagonist setup of Rebecca &amp; Billy, it beginning on the Ecliptic Express train, and the death of Edward as he leaps through the window. Though there are certain features planned for the prototype that never made it into the full game; most notably is how one of the two protagonists could die, but the game wouldn't end unless both Rebecca &amp; Billy perish. This idea was scrapped due to how Rebecca canonically dying would conflict against her appearance in the original Resident Evil. 'Running zombies' was another idea that was scrapped for RE0, though would pave the way for the design of the Crimson Heads in the Resident Evil remake.</p><p>During development for Zero's remastered release, Capcom released footage of RE0's prototype version to the public. It was shown to still be using the zombie moan fxs from Resident Evil 2, likely due to Resident Evil 2 being ported to the N64 years before. Billy's voice actor is also noted as the same one that would voice him in the full release.</p><p>Weirdly enough Rebecca is also shown to be wearing a beret, which is more so recognizable as the iconic hat of choice for Jill Valentine in her STARS uniform. There also exists concept art of Rebecca wearing a beret as well, despite the fact that she has never been depicted wearing such an item before in the series. Though it's possible that she was to lose the beret during the events of RE0.

The game was released in Japan in June 2004 and in North America and Europe in September of that same year. Silent Hill 4 was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 and the Microsoft Xbox consoles as well as the PC. A soundtrack release was also made at the same time.</p><p>Unlike the previous installments, which were set primarily in the disturbed town of Silent Hill, this game is set in the fictional town of South Ashfield and is focused on the character of Henry Townshend attempting to escape from his locked-down apartment. He explores a series of supernatural worlds and finds himself in conflict with an undead serial killer.</p><p>Originally intended as a spinoff from the main series, Silent Hill 4 features an altered gameplay style with <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> navigation when exploring the eponymous room. </p><h2>Characters</h2><p> </p><h3><a href=\"/henry-townshend/3005-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3569\">Henry Townshend</a></h3><p> </p><p>The games main protagonist. Henry awakes to find himself trapped within his apartment by mysterious crisscrossing, padlocked chains on his front door. He's also plagued by horrible recurring nightmares. After being trapped for some time, a hole develops in his bathroom which he can use to travel to horrifying \"other worlds\". Through his travels he meets the other characters of the game. There's not much info on Henry's background but its speculated that he may have been a professional photographer. He's an introvert that mainly keeps to himself, making very few acquaintances and being like a ghost to the other tenants of the apartment complex.</p><p> </p><h3><a href=\"/eileen-galvin/3005-3609/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3609\">Eileen Galvin</a></h3><p> </p><p>Henry's next door neighbor, whom he spies on regularly through a hole in the wall. He's to shy to directly speak to her, but finally gets his chance later in the game to meet her face to face. She had once met Walter Sullivan, when she was a but a small child and he was a troubled teen. She offered Walter her favorite teddy bear in efforts to cheer him up. This sparked a life-long memory of her in Walters mind, and he intends to use her as his 20th Victim in the 21 Sacraments ritual. Depending on the ending achieved, she is either killed by Walter to complete the 21 Sacraments ritual, killed before Walter and the failing of the ritual, or she survives to live another day, now hand in hand with Henry.</p><p> </p><h3><a href=\"/walter-sullivan/3005-5778/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5778\">Walter Sullivan</a> (Adult)</h3><p> </p><p>The games main antagonist. Walter was raised in an orphanage operated by the mysterious cult The Order, known as \"The Wish House\", however, he was born within Room 302, Henry's current apartment. He believed that this room was his mother, and that he must now complete the 21 Sacraments ritual to purify her. Thanks to other rituals he's completed, he is nearly invincible and has gained an assortment of other seemingly magical powers. He went on a brief killing spree, taking 10 people's lives in ten days (briefly described by newspaper clippings in Silent Hill 2), and was captured by law enforcement officers and imprisoned. Within prison he completed the Ritual of Assumption by taking his own life with a spoon, (also described in notes found in Silent Hill 2), thus creating the otherworld he now inhabits and controls.</p><p> </p><h3>Walter Sullivan (Child)</h3><p> </p><p>This physical manifestation of Walter's former self was separated from him during one of his rituals. He represents what little good is left within Walter's soul, but his particular role in all of this remains unclear. He is unaware of Walter's intentions and only wants to be with his mother once again. At one point, he saves Eileen from death.</p><p> </p><h3><a href=\"/cynthia-velasquez/3005-6230/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6230\">Cynthia Velasquez</a></h3><p> </p><p>A young woman that Henry meets towards the beginning of the game. She finds herself trapped in the mysterious subway portion of the Other world, and assumes that it's all just a bad dream. When she's met, she offers Henry what is assumed to be a sexual favor if he helps her escape. They are separated for a brief amount of time, and when Henry stumbles upon her again, she's been killed by multiple stab wounds, acting as Walter's 16th victim in the 21 Sacraments ritual. Henry must fight her ghost in the next area to proceed. In the opening segment of the game, if the player (as Henry) looks out the bedroom window upon the street, they can see Cynthia entering the Subway stairwell.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Common enemies</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/sniffer-dog/3015-6020/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6020\">Sniffer Dogs</a></li><li><a href=\"/twin-victims/3015-6084/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6084\">Twin Victims</a></li><li><a href=\"/bottom/3015-6021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6021\">Bottom</a></li><li><a href=\"/greedy-worm/3015-6085/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6085\">Greedy Worm</a></li><li><a href=\"/gumhead/3015-6022/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6022\">Gum Head</a></li><li><a href=\"/hummer/3015-6024/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6024\">Hummer</a></li><li><a href=\"/toadstool/3015-6030/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6030\">Toadstool / Whitestool</a></li><li><a href=\"/tremor/3015-6027/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6027\">Tremor</a></li><li><a href=\"/wallman/3015-6033/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6033\">Wall Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/wheelchair/3015-6086/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6086\">Wheelchair</a></li><li><a href=\"/alchemilla-nurses/3015-5724/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5724\">Patient</a></li></ul><h3>Ghosts/bosses</h3><ul><li>Walter's Victims (Ghosts)</li></ul><ul><li>The One Truth</li><li>Sacrificed Walter</li><li>Walter Sullivan</li></ul><h2>Endings</h2><h3>21 Sacraments Ending</h3><p>This is the worst of the 4 endings. Walter kills all 21 of his subjects, thereby completing the 21 Sacraments ritual. The entire apartment building is possessed, and Walter's spirit returns to it. Eileen Galvin is not saved, and Henry dies later in his apartment.</p><h3>Mother Ending</h3><p>If the player defeats Walter before Eileens death, the 21 Sacraments ritual fails, and Eileen survives. However, so does Walter. The ending does not flesh out the details after this event, leaving the player unclear on the outcome of the Apartment building, or Walter.</p><h3>Eileen's Death Ending</h3><p>This ending can only be achieved if all hauntings in Henry's apartment are exorcized. Eileen dies during the fight with Walter, but since Henry survives, the 21 Sacraments ritual fails and the apartment building is returned to normal.</p><h3>Escape Ending</h3><p>The best of all four endings. All hauntings have been exorcized, Henry and Eileen survive, 21 Sacraments ritual fails, and Walter is defeated. Henry and Eileen leave together to find a new home, leaving South Ashfield Heights happily behind them.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The music for Silent Hill 4: The Room was composed by <a href=\"/akira-yamaoka/3040-40927/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40927\">Akira Yamaoka</a>.</p><h3>Track list:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817855-sh4os.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817855\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817855-sh4os.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817855\"><img alt=\"Silent Hill 4: The Room - Original Soundtrack\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817855-sh4os.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817855-sh4os.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 4: The Room - Original Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><p><b>01.</b> <i>Tender Sugar</i> (5:32)</p><p><b>02.</b> <i>Waverer</i> (2:54)</p><p><b>03.</b> <i>Fortunate Sleep -No One Disturb Her Dead-</i> (2:06)</p><p><b>04.</b> <i>Melancholy Requiem</i> (3:53)</p><p><b>05.</b> <i>Confinement</i> (2:27)</p><p><b>06.</b> <i>Drops Of Shame</i> (2:49)</p><p><b>07.</b> <i>The Suicidal Clock Chime</i> (1:10)</p><p><b>08.</b> <i>Silent Circus</i> (2:55)</p><p><b>09.</b> <i>Traversing The Portals Of Reality</i> (2:03)</p><p><b>10.</b> <i>Into The Depths Of Self Discovery</i> (2:55)</p><p><b>11.</b> <i>Cradel Of Forest</i> (6:30)</p><p><b>12.</b> <i>Resting Comfortably</i> (0:51)</p><p><b>13.</b> <i>Nightmarish Waltz</i> (3:09)</p><p><b>14.</b> <i>Pulsating Ambience</i> (3:04)</p><p><b>15.</b> <i>Your Rain</i> (4:42)</p><p><b>16.</b> <i>The Last Mariachi</i> (1:37)</p><p><b>17.</b> <i>Wounded Warsong</i> (3:12)</p><p><b>18.</b> <i>Underground Dawn -Never Come-</i> (2:12)</p><p><b>19.</b> <i>Fever Chill</i> (2:28)</p><p><b>20.</b> <i>Remodeling</i> (2:54)</p><p><b>21.</b> <i>Room Of Angel</i> (7:08)</p><p><b>22.</b> <i>Waiting For You ~LIVE AT \"Heaven's Night\"~</i> (unreleased tunes) (6:19)</p>", "deck": "Silent Hill 4 is the fourth installment of the Survival-Horror series of the same name.

It quickly becomes clear that Cayne's real intent is to discuss his views on human cloning and his obsession with capturing the genetically engineered super assassin. Cayne lies about many of the details that he gives Rick Henderson such as stating that 47 stole cloning data from <a href=\"/dr-otto-wolfgang-ort-meyer/3005-3879/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3879\">Ort-Meyer</a> to sell to the highest bidder.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932945\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.8\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932945\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/932945-hbm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The story of 47 is gradually revealed as the player completes the various contracts they receive. The main story really begins when Diana informs 47 that they are the only two left in the agency. It is implied that the others have been systematically wiped out by Mark Purayah II and <a href=\"/mark-parchezzi-iii/3005-3753/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III</a> - two of The Franchise's best assassins.</p><p>Diana finally decides to close down the agency but not before she gives 47 one final contract. This is the mission \"A Dance with the Devil\", where 47 must infiltrate a party at the CIA headquarters and take out the assassins who are trying to kill him. Once this is complete he and Diana split the funds and go their separate ways.</p><p>After what seems to be 47's final contract he is approached by an old CIA acquaintance named Smith (who 47 has previously rescued from a rehabilitation clinic in the mission \"Flatline\"). He requests that 47 take on a mission to kill the men who are trying to assassinate the President of the United States. These men are Vice President Daniel Morris and <a href=\"/mark-parchezzi-iii/3005-3753/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III</a>, who are both working for Alpha Xerox. This is a political organization which owns \"The Franchise\" and wish to monopolize the cloning facility that created 47. They want the President taken out before the elections so that he is definitely not elected and so he cannot forward his pro-cloning policy. This would prevent Alpha Xerox from attaining the monopoly on cloning.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 1440w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3419/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>During this mission 47 successfully kills Morris and also finally takes down Parchezzi in a shootout on the roof of the White House. After this mission a newspaper article is shown which states that the authorities believe Parchezzi to be Morris' assassin. As he is now being hunted by both enemy operatives and the police 47 retreats to his hideout. Here he is approached by Diana without warning which instantly arouses his suspicion as they rarely meet face to face. She proposes a plan which should secure both of them safety from \"The Franchise\". As 47 is considering the idea and reading the briefing he expresses his doubts about its success. However, before he can say any more Diana injects him with what seems to be a poison. 47's body is quickly surrounded by SWAT members, and Diana, announcing that bringing down 47 was \"surprisingly pleasant\" is inducted into \"The Franchise\" by Cayne, it's founder.</p><p>After this event the plot suddenly returns to present day, with Cayne and Rick Henderson, where 47's body is about to be cremated so that rival cloning companies cannot take a sample of his bone marrow and no more non-defective clones can ever be made. Diana approaches 47's body and places his signature <a href=\"/amt-hardballer/3055-483/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-483\">Silverballer</a> pistols on his chest during his funeral and kisses him after applying lipstick. It then becomes clear that the \"poison\" that Diana used on 47 was actually a fake death serum which is used earlier in the game and that her lipstick contained the antidote. This shows that this was Diana's true plan to save them both and she did not betray 47. The game can then end in one of two ways. As the player watches 47 lying on a pedestal before he is cremated a faint heartbeat can be heard. If the player does not react in any way then 47 will be lowered into the crematorium and will perish. However, if the player keeps spinning both of the analog sticks then 47 will come back to life and the player will have to control him as he takes out all of the witnesses to his revival. Many of the witnesses try to escape but it becomes apparent that Diana has locked the gates of the exit and no one survives except 47 (and Diana, who had left earlier).</p><p>The game ends with a cut-scene in which Diana states that she has made the Agency operational again using the funds of \"The Franchise\". She is on the phone with someone who she refers to as \"Your Majesty\". Diana then says to this mysterious person that the Agency has lost track of 47. The game finally ends with 47 in a brothel having a conversation with a traditionally dressed Chinese man on what can only be assumed is another job.</p><h2>Missions</h2><p>The missions during the game are listed below, along with a brief overview of how they are tasked, and the intel that can be purchased in the pre-mission briefing. Typically, the missions occur in order of difficulty though for the inexperienced or violent player, <i>A Vintage Year</i> can pose more problems than some other missions due to the small corridors of the house and the guards who are armed with shotguns and the SAF SMG.</p><h3>The Death of a Showman</h3><p>The Death of a Showman is the tutorial level for Hitman: Blood Money, and is intended to introduce the player to the mechanics of the game, such as poisoning food or water. The mission involves assassinating Joseph Clarence, better known as 'Mr. Swing King', after an accident at his amusement park caused the deaths of several children. One vengeful parent decides that Mr. Swing King should be punished severely. Enemies during the level are gang members, as the amusement park is being used by a 'Mr. Scoop' in order to produce drugs under a supposed agreement that will allow Clarence to restart his amusement park. The Death of a Showman is considered by players as a poor tutorial, as it encourages killing enemies who do not otherwise need to be killed to complete an objective. For example, one of the instructions is to kill two gang members in a room with a shotgun, before hiding the bodies. It would theoretically be possible to continue without having to kill them. The Death of a Showman has no intel, and does not need to be completed for Xbox 360 <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements</a> related to completing the game on different difficulty settings. It is not possible to receive a rating on this level.</p><h3>A Vintage Year</h3><p>A Vintage Year is the first 'true' mission of the game, and places Agent 47 in <a href=\"/chile/3035-3002/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3002\">Chile</a>, during a wine convention held by one Fernando Delgado. His son, Manuel, is using the vineyard as a front for distributing cocaine. Only Fernando was requested for execution by a client, though it is viewed as safer to eliminate Manuel as well, in order to make it appear as a drug-related killing. The mission introduces a camera, used by a Chilean television crew who are present at the event. As usual, Agent 47 should be avoiding the cameras to complete the hits set out. To escape, players depart using a seaplane which has docked at the vineyard.</p><p>Due to the nature of this mission, it is one of the hardest missions to play aggressively. Guards are armed with the pump-action shotguns, while VIP Guards wield the SAF SMG. Unusually the VIP Guards are less well armed than the standard guards due to the relatively tight confines of the villa, where the shotgun can do the most damage. VIP Guards have access to the villa and drug lab though standard guards do not. A Vintage Year is the first mission where a player can earn the Silent Assassin rating, and also introduces intel you may buy to make your mission easier to complete.

Agent 47 has been tasked to assassinate two men: Richard Delahunt, and Alvaro D'Alvade. Richard Delahunt is an American ambassador with a fascination for D'Alvade, who is performing as the tenor in <i>Tosca</i>, which is being performed. Agent 47's chance to strike comes when the tenor faces a firing squad, and strike he does. The two men supposedly run a child trafficking ring in Eastern Europe, and a client has requested their death. Agent 47 is dispatched to make this a reality.</p><p>It is during Curtains Down that we first see specialized bodyguards protecting Delahunt. It is possible to dress as the executioner and shoot Alvaro yourself, though it is much easier to simply replace the prop Mauser pistol he uses with a real pistol that can be attained through talking with the secretary. It is also possible to take 47's talents onto the stage by dressing as one of the supporting actors, and taking a prop rifle. You may then stand and watch Alvaro's death at the hands of his unwitting killer.</p><p>It is possible to complete this mission in less than a minute, though with a very low rating. If a player is on a low difficulty, they can shoot their way in to the box where Delahunt watches from, and then shoot Alvaro D'Alvade as he acts his role on the stage. This method ceases to work on higher difficulties, where Agent 47 will be killed before being able to line up a shot with Alvaro on the stage below, or before he can reach the exit again. It is entirely possible to finish the mission in this manner on both Easy and Normal difficulties though is not recommended for Expert or Professional levels for obvious reasons.</p><p>Completing Curtains Down with a Silent Assassin rating is difficult due to the vigilant guards and long time spent waiting in order to ensure all enemies are in position for you to make your moves. The approach involves replacing the executioner's pistol with a real World War I-era handgun so that he will shoot D'Alvade dead. When Delahunt runs towards the scene he will trip on the carpet, so the chandelier above can be rigged with an RU-AP Mine to eliminate him as an 'accident'.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>The content of toolboxes will not be searched when you are frisked.</li><li>There is a lift shaft from the backstage area to the stage.

Agent 47 has been tasked with helping Smith out of the facility, despite its reputation for not letting patients out unless they are 'sober or dead'.</p><p>The members of the crime families reside in New York, and become targets due to a shift in the balance of the crime families working in the city. To smuggle Smith out, you will need an experimental serum that will give him the appearance of being dead, without actually killing him. This is because the facility Smith has been checked into is renowned as being the toughest rehab clinic in the United States. Diana Burnwood states that the only way someone will get out is if they are \"clean or dead\".</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Admission papers are required to check-in.

Given a new identity and home by the government, his ex-compatriots want him dead before he gives a court hearing against them. Agent 47 is the go-to guy to making snitches disappear, so Sinistra is no different. He is holding a birthday celebration for his daughter, and this provides an ample time to eliminate him. However, his wife possesses a piece of information that would still be of value regardless of Vinnie's position in the world: on it, or buried in it. It is a piece of microfilm, hidden in her necklace. It is vital that this microfilm is removed from the crime scene, lest the evidence contained be used to convict Sinistra's ex-allies.</p><p>Despite the birthday party being clearly intended for a young girl (there is a clown as an entertainer), there is no child present in the level due to the media controversy it would cause.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Garbage trucks can dispose of all kinds of waste.</li><li>The surveillance team has an unhealthy appetite for donuts.</li><li>Vinnie has complained about the neighbor's son taking pot shots into the garden with an airgun.</li><li>Vinnie lives close to a veterinary surgeon.

Members of the shadowy 'Alpha Xerox' group intend to put a permanent stop to his election campaign, lest he poses a threat to them later in their plans. 47 has been contracted to eliminate all those who intend to cancel the election speech.</p><p>The key members of the attack, and the guards, are dressed as birds. The 'crows', as the hit-squad are known, communicate via walkie-talkie. Mark II is the mastermind behind the assassination, while Raymond Kulinsky acts as the shooter. Angelina Mason does not provide a major role, unless she discovers Kulinsky's death, in which case she will stab the senator to death, sacrificing herself to complete their mission. It is utterly vital that the politician, and his float, are protected during the celebrations.</p><p>As a bonus, a case of blood diamonds are changing hands during the festivities, and Agent 47 will be paid extra should he manage to bring them as well. The diamonds are carried by a red bird seen in the hotel at the beginning of the mission, and he will take them across to Mark II by the bookshop. It is possible to intercept him on the way there or walk out, killing Mark II and taking the diamonds as well. Entering the area without the diamonds as the red bird will cause the AI to begin demanding the diamonds on a constant loop, meaning the mission will be virtually impossible to finish.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Walkie Talkies transmit everything - even background sound and music, which could reveal someone's location.</li><li>Clubs usually have a back entrance for the staff.</li><li>Bookstore walls are like paper - you can overhear what's going on next door.</li><li>Clubs in this area are known for having hat-dress codes and music themes.</li><li>Some private apartments have a useful view.</li><li>Pianos can kill - especially when they are dropped from the sky.</li><li>A guy dressed as a yellow bird checked into a hotel room a couple of hours ago.</li><li>Cost is $3,500 each</li><li>Cost for all 7 = $24,500</li><li>Grand Total = $122,500</li></ul><h3>You Better Watch Out..</h3><p>Lorne de Havilland is a porn tycoon, who is holding a Christmas party at his reclusive mansion. VIPs have been invited to the proceedings to enjoy a little Christmas gift, and one of the attendees must be eliminated. Lorne de Havilland has footage of Chad Bingham Jr., son of a US senator, getting a little 'rough' with one of Lorne's girls. The girl didn't survive the events that followed, and Lorne intends to use this videotape to bribe the senator. Eliminate Chad to prevent such occurrences in the future, and Lorne to prevent him from going public with the story. The videotape must also disappear.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Don't expect any presents this year - Santa drinks too much.</li><li>The bartender knows how to help improve performance in the grottos!</li><li>Waiters often shower in the staff changing room.</li><li>Even small, annoying dogs eat sausages.</li><li>The glass-bottomed outdoor jacuzzi looks down on the pier, 70 feet below.</li><li>Among high society, spiked drinks are all the rage.</li><li>Heavy light rigs are installed in the Photo Studio.</li><li>Lorne recently hired a former US Air force helicopter Pilot.</li><li>Cost is $3,500 each</li><li>Cost for all 8 = $28,000</li><li>Grand Total = $150,500</li></ul><h3>Death on the Mississippi</h3><p>Skip Muldoon operates a paddle ship on the Mississippi river, and he uses it to allow a local gang to move drugs across the river. This gang call themselves the 'Gator Boys', and in return for Skip turning a blind eye to their doings, he receives their protection as guards. There are six key members of the gang, and Skip Muldoon himself. With all of these keys removed, the Gator Boys have no hope of survival. Agent 47 is contracted to collapse the Gator Boys in a single days' work. Skip also possesses some compromising pictures, which must be removed from the crime scene.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>The engine room is off limits to passengers - the furnace is a dangerous workplace.</li><li>Man overboard - the wild waters of the river will cause certain death.</li><li>The captain's cake is being prepared in the galley in the rear of the 4th deck.</li><li>Only 1st Class Parsers are allowed in the Gators Private area.</li><li>The lower class kitchen prepares food for both the tourists on board as well as the Gators on the top deck.

Agent 47 has been contracted for another mission in Mississippi, this time to eliminate a groom at a wedding, and the bride's father. The bride is strictly off-limits and must not be injured during proceedings. The Groom has something of a sweet-tooth, and frequently samples some of the icing from his wedding cake. This could provide a window of opportunity for a swift elimination.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Guns and shooting in outdoor areas don't make rednecks panic</li><li>The water is home to alligators.</li><li>The priest rings the Wedding Bell to announce the ceremony.</li><li>The Father's recently deceased brother is buried at the family graveyard.</li><li>The Groom can't keep himself away from the whipped cream on the wedding cake.</li><li>Cost is $3,500 each</li><li>Cost for all 5 = $17,500</li><li>Grand Total = $189,000</li></ul><h3>A House of Cards</h3><p>Las Vegas. Sin City. Agent 47 is on his way to the most morally deprived location in the United States to deal with an Arab Sheikh, and put an end to a deal. The Sheikh is meeting with a white supremacist from South Africa to exchange conflict diamonds for human DNA. An optional objective, that includes additional payment, is to steal the conflict diamonds. It's not like the targets are going to need them.</p><p>Completing this mission with a Silent Assassin rating can be done by following some online strategies, though it is well known that the AI for the Sheik can bug, leading him to repeat the \"This is a very large casino\" line of dialogue for an extended period of time.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>It would be wise to check in at the hotel reception.</li><li>Staff have keycards that only provide access to the floors they're guarding.</li><li>There's an Agency pickup at room #701.</li><li>Fire alarms are located at the top floors.</li><li>Room balconies may provide good vantage points.</li><li>Only waiters are allowed into the VIP room the Sheik has requested.</li><li>No cell phones allowed in the casino.

To begin with, you are asked to eliminate an FBI agent and his girlfriend, who are attending different parties at the same office block in Las Vegas. Vaana can be found in the Hell party, and Anthony in the Heaven party. Upon assassinating one of the two, other targets will become apparent. A female assassin called Eve, and a male assassin called Maynard John become targets as well. Eve likens herself to a spider, and Maynard John has a passion for the theatrical, referring to Agent 47 as 'less than human'. John challenges Agent 47 to a duel, in the Hell Party. It is a duel Agent 47 cannot afford to lose.</p><h4>Intel</h4><ul><li>Trailers arrived earlier with decorations for the parties.</li><li>Information about who is trying to kill you might be found on a laptop on the top floor.</li><li>Don't go for a swim in the shark tanks at the Hell party.</li><li>Be careful playing with pyrotechnics - they could kill someone.</li><li>Bartenders are usually well informed.</li><li>Look out for the singer at the heaven party.

The assassin is 'Mark III': the upgraded, enhanced version of Mark Purayah II. <a href=\"/mark-parchezzi-iii/3005-3753/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Parchezzi</a> is utterly relentless, but he is only one of the conspirators.

Agent 47 will awake from his induced coma, and you are tasked with eliminating all of the witnesses: including <a href=\"/jack-alexander-leland-cayne/3005-3749/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3749\">Jack Cayne</a>. Requiem is considered as a canon mission, and among those eliminated is Rick Henderson. <a href=\"/diana-burnwood/3005-1841/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood</a> is not present, as it appears she ensured 47 could accomplish this feat, using the serum that was seen during 'Flatline'.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Blood Money follows the same path as the previous Hitman games in many regards. The basic concept remains the same, you must take out your mark(s) any way you see fit. The way you go about this is entirely up to you and the game this time around gives you even more options then the previous Hitman games to leave your personal touch.</p><p>One new game mechanic is the ability to use 'environmental' kills, i.e. rigging a bomb to a beam and then waiting for the right moment to remotely detonate it and take out your mark. Another new feature is the ability to customize your weaponry and gadgets. This can consist of larger magazines, red dot and laser sights, better silencers, armor piercing rounds which can go through doors and Kevlar vests, and many more tweaks. Other new abilities 47 has is the ability to take hostages, throw weapons and bombs, and the much welcomed close combat attacks. Nothing feels better than head butting someone and then punching them in the face, or the ability to grab a threats weapon while elbowing them in the face in the process (however you always take the chance that they may pull the trigger, resulting in alerting nearby guards).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3107/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Another new addition to gameplay is the concept of witnesses, which are any AI character(s) who witness you do something violent during a mission and survive to talk about it. Witnesses can negatively impact your overall rating at the end of a mission, so in many cases you must be even more careful in Blood Money then in previous Hitman games. However a witness is no longer a threat if they are dead\u2026</p><p>Which brings us to another new concept in Blood Money, your notoriety level. Your notoriety is dictated by the number of witnesses that are alive at the end of any given mission. Your notoriety will carry through to the next mission you attempt, the higher your notoriety the more likely someone will be able to see through your disguise and identify you as a fugitive. However, one can always opt to decrease their notoriety at the end of each mission, for a price.</p><p>The newspaper is another new game feature which the player gets to see at the end of each mission, which describes the murder(s) they committed. The newspaper can also offer a deeper back story of the mark(s) you just took out and the articles surrounding the main article are usually an entertaining read as well as hinting at what will happen in later missions.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Blood Money contains an assortment of upgradeable weapons, which players may choose to bring along when on a contract. To upgrade a weapon, the player needs money, which is attained from successfully completing missions. Each weapon has 5 levels to upgrade, with each level increasingly more expensive.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Level 1</th><th>Level 2</th><th>Level 3</th><th>Level 4</th><th>Level 5</th></tr><tr><td>$50,000</td><td>$75,000</td><td>$100,000</td><td>$150,000</td><td>$200,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are 5 unique upgradeable weapons.

In most artwork for the games he is brandishing at least one Hardballer, but he is capable of firing two at once. In Blood Money, the Hardballer can be modified and upgraded with different optics and parts, which can be very helpful.</p><p>In-game the Hardballer is referred to as the Silverballer, and is the signature weapon of Agent 47 in the Hitman franchise. Upgrades make it one of the most versatile weapons in the entire game, and potentially the best all-rounder as well. It can even be used to make shorter range sniper shots, as well as acting as a close range machine pistol depending on how it is configured.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Level</b></p></td><td><p><b>Upgrade</b></p></td><td><p><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>1</b></p></td><td><p>Low Velocity Ammo</p></td><td><p>Low Velocity ammo is one of the two initial upgrades available for the AMT Hardballer, and is almost completely essential. Recoil is vastly decreased, and the ammunition can work similarly to a suppressor. When using one, there is no real need for the other, at least until the second suppressor becomes available.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Silencer Type 1</p></td><td><p>The silencer is a signature of the professional, and decreases the noise of the weapon when it is being fired. In Hitman: Blood Money the silencer does not seem to impact the power of the weapon, meaning that it is a good choice on all contracts, should a gun be essential to bring.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>2</b></p></td><td><p>Extra Ammo</p></td><td><p>'Extra Ammo' is a permanent benefit, and cannot be removed. It does not make a visual change to the weapon, and allows you to carry two additional magazines. The actual quantity of extra ammunition carried changes depending on whether or not Extended Magazines is also used. If not, you will carry 18 additional rounds - two magazines. If it is equipped, you will have 36 rounds, which is still two (larger) magazines.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"/laser-sight/3055-1819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">Laser Sight</a></p></td><td>The laser sight is mounted below the barrel of the gun, and allows for more precision when firing. The crosshair is replaced with a red dot emitted from the laser. This can allow for more precise firing, but is more useful when using the first-person camera. It can still be used with third-person, but it does not provide the same benefit.</td></tr><tr><td><p>Rail Mount</p></td><td><p>The Rail Mount is required for the Red Dot Sight and Scope, much like the modified handguard for the M4 assault rifle. If you do not purchase this before the optics you wish to own, then you will be prompted to purchase both at the same time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>3</b></p></td><td><p>Magnum Ammo</p></td><td><p>Much noisier, and with a higher recoil than standard or low velocity ammunition, the Magnum Ammo sounds like a poor choice. However, these two cons are balanced by massive firepower and extreme damage. A single shot to the chest of a victim normally guarantees a kill when using Magnum Ammo.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Long Slide</p></td><td><p>Longer slide for the Hardballer. This selection decreases recoil, and increases the accuracy of the shooter. When used with Low Velocity ammunition it is worth considering, at least until the second Silencer is unlocked, whereupon it is <i>normally</i> a better choice.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">Dual Wield</a></p></td><td><p>Double the firepower, double the fun. The second Hardballer gives you more of everything. It is normally a good choice, though when carrying a briefcase or two-handed weapon, you will only draw the one, as opposed to the two weapons.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>4</b></p></td><td><p><a href=\"/red-dot-sight/3055-1037/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1037\">Red Dot Sight</a></p></td><td>A Red Dot Sight is mounted on the slide of the gun, providing a more accurate sight than the Laser Sight which was made available earlier in the game. The RDS is viewed as a scope of sorts, and as such, it has some sway and Agent 47 will hold his breath. It is relatively accurate, but experienced shooters may find it a drawback if they can line up a <a href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-85\">headshot</a> easily with previous attachments.</td></tr><tr><td><p>Large Clip</p></td><td><p>Doubles the size of the magazines used in the weapon, from 9 rounds to 18. Trigger-happy players will <i>love</i> this, but it also serves a useful benefit if compromised. Combined with the second pistol, available as a 'Tier 3' unlock, this makes the ultimate combination for the inaccurate player.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>5</b></p></td><td><p>Silencer Type 2</p></td><td><p>Bigger, better, and quieter. The Type 2 Silencer is much quieter than the Type 1, and is a fairly useful piece of equipment in all scenarios. It beats the Type 1 Silencer in all ways, and if a silenced weapon is one of your preferences, then this will improve on the base weapon in many different ways.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Full Auto Fire</p></td><td><p>Full-Auto modifies the internals of the Silverballer to make it capable of firing fully automatic, as opposed to semi-automatic. Recoil builds more quickly with this customisation, and ammo is drained much faster, but it is potentially extremely useful in areas with a large number of guards present.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"/scope/3055-738/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">Scope</a></p></td><td><p>A Scope, which will be mounted on the Rail Mount along the slide of the gun. It cannot be used with the Red Dot Sight, but provides more zoom and extreme precision. It does not give the same range as 47's Walther 2000 sniper rifle, but it can still be used for longer-range engagements.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a href=\"/spas-12/3055-1364/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1364\">SPAS-12</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337232\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.78125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337232\"><img alt=\"A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/749/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.</figcaption></figure><p>Like any shotgun, the SPAS-12 (or SP-12, as it is identified in-game) decreases in usefulness across longer ranges. It cannot be concealed either, and is therefore useless in stealthy engagements. It can be suppressed and all other kinds of benefits, but ultimately the usefulness comes down to whether or not players are prepared to find a method of bringing the shotgun in and out.</p><p>Should the SPAS-12 be brought on a mission it can be advantageous to attempt to find a way of not alerting guards that you have it initially, since sneaking towards the target with it could lead to being able to drop the weapon and escape incognito. If necessary it could also be used to shoot your way back out towards safety.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Level</b></p></td><td><p><b>Upgrade</b></p></td><td><p><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>1</b></p></td><td><p>Flechette Ammo</p></td><td><p>Flechette Ammo allows for more accuracy, and less spread. However, the damage is decreased with this. It may still be worthwhile if the shotgun's spread is a problem.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Butt Stock</p></td><td><p>The Butt Stock decreases the recoil of the SP-12, and is worthwhile for this reason alone. The SP-12 recoil is manageable without it though, so for players who are trying to conserve their cash there is no real need.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>2</b></p></td><td><p>Extra Ammo</p></td><td><p>Provides additional ammo.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reload Boost</p></td><td><p>Mounts more ammunition on the side of the weapon, ready for when you need it. It divides the reload time by precisely half, making it quite useful in some situations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12 Gauge Slugs</p></td><td><p>The ultimate slug for causing damage to a target, but with absolutely no precision at all. Think Rambo... and then a little less accurate. Still, if you want to guarantee it's dead, accept nothing else.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>3</b></p></td><td><p>Rail Mount</p></td><td><p>The Rail Mount is a necessity for the Red Dot Sight to be mountable on the gun. It is not worth buying unless you intend to mount the Red Dot Sight on the SP-12, as otherwise it has no benefit.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Short Barrel</p></td><td><p>The shortened barrel makes a brutal increase in damage a reality, but as you'd expect, it comes at the cost of accuracy. Experienced shotgun users likely will not have a problem with this, but ultimately the appeal of the shortened barrel is limited.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>4</b></p></td><td><p>Laser Sight</p></td><td><p>Provides a laser pointer for additional accuracy, and increased likelihood of hitting the target. Due to the fact that the shotgun is a close range weapon, a laser sight is not entirely necessary, but it might be worthwhile nonetheless.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magazine</p></td><td><p>Improves the SP-12's rate of fire considerably, making it into a semi-automatic shotgun as compared to a pump-action. Plus, it increases the reload speed vastly. If you use the shotgun frequently, this is a very useful purchase to get the most from it.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>5</b></p></td><td><p>Red Dot Sight</p></td><td><p>Improves accuracy when being used, but it is ultimately not a massive help on a shotgun. Some players may prefer using the shotgun with this attachment, but it does not give a drastic improvement in accuracy unless you use the first-person view when shooting.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Silencer Type 1</p></td><td><p>The only silencer available for the SP-12, it has the exact same properties as the silencers for other weapons: it decreases the noise of the weapon as it is fired. This is an essential to anyone who intends to replay missions with a shotgun, due to the fact that the weapon makes a very easily-identified blast.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>SMG Tactical</h3><p>The SMG Tactical appears to be based on Heckler &amp; Koch's <a href=\"/mp5/3055-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-289\">MP5</a> and <a href=\"/mp5k/3055-2972/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2972\">MP5k</a> designs, and is heavily customisable. Initially it is a small weapon, let down by its similarly small magazine size. However, upgrades can make the SMG Tactical a viable weapon choice, particularly due to the fact that it is concealable and can be smuggled into different locations rifles and shotguns could not.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Level</b></p></td><td><p><b>Upgrade</b></p></td><td><p><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>1</b></p></td><td><p>Butt Stock 1 or 2</p></td><td><p>Less recoil, more precision. The differences are cosmetic: The first one is a fixed, synthetic, MP5A2-style buttstock, while the other one is a metal MP5A3-style buttstock of the retractable kind.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Low Velocity Ammo</p></td><td><p>Acts in the same manner as the Low Velocity ammunition for the AMT Hardballer. It is quite useful with the SMG Tactical as well, due to the fact that it decreases recoil, and due to the weapon's unlock tree, a silencer does not become available for quite some time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>2</b></p></td><td><p>Extra Ammo</p></td><td><p>Provides an extra two magazines of ammunition to bring to the party. It does not make a cosmetic change and cannot be disabled, but it is definitely worthwhile.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rail Mount</p></td><td><p>The Rail Mount is needed to place the Red Dot Sight on the SMG Tactical. Without the Rail Mount the RDS cannot be purchased and mounted on the weapon, so it is definitely a worthwhile purchase for this reason. It doesn't need to be purchased unless you intend to use the Red Dot Sight though, as it provides no other benefits.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magnum Ammo</p></td><td><p>Magnum Ammo is louder and has more recoil than standard or low velocity ammunition, but it shreds a target apart with ease. It also rips through doors, so if you're not concerned with stealth, why not leave a 'lasting impression' upon your target? With massive power, a shot or two in the chest area will almost always yield results.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>3</b></p></td><td><p>Rapid Fire</p></td><td><p>A massively increased rate of fire, which is very useful with the smaller frame and shorter barrel. It is less accurate, and recoil will build more quickly, but this is really only an attachment for closer range engagements.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Short Barrel</p></td><td><p>A shortened barrel for the SMG Tactical, which helps to look a lot like the MP5k. It decreases the weapon's accuracy though, but ultimately it does work well with equipment such as the increased rate of fire.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Silencer Type 1</p></td><td><p>Like all suppressors for weapons, the silencer for the SMG Tactical allows you to fire without immediately alerting everyone to your presence. It has limited usefulness when combined with the Low Velocity Ammunition, however.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>4</b></p></td><td><p>Laser Sight</p></td><td><p>The Laser Sight fits a laser pointer onto the SMG Tactical, and allows for increased accuracy. The crosshair is replaced with the pinpoint red dot emitted from the laser sight, but it does not have a major benefit unless you are using the first-person viewpoint for shooting accurately.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Double Clip</p></td><td><p>Having a second magazine nearby will always speed up reloading, and this attachment is always valuable for frequent reloaders. Having a second magazine attached to the first one means that you can simply move from one magazine to the other, and save vital seconds. It is particularly useful when involved in firefights, as reloading is normally the moment when you will be destroyed by enemy fire.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>5</b></p></td><td><p>Silencer Type 2</p></td><td><p>Decreases firing noise even further than Silencer Type 1.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Red Dot Sight</p></td><td><p>A small amount of zoom and improved accuracy; provides you with a red dot.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a href=\"/m4-carbine/3055-622/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-622\">M4</a></h3><p>The M4 is an American-made killing machine, and appears to be the only assault rifle employed by the Agency.

As the game is an earlier 360 title, many players did not realise this, and had not upgraded their sets to either HDTVs or televisions which could support the game. When attempting to play Blood Money on a 50Hz television, it will simply show a black screen.</p><h3>Advertising Controversy</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-195020\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.59139784946237\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-195020\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-width=\"465\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg 465w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3107/195020-hitman_briefcase.jpg 465w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-width=\"465\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Hitman: Blood Money had been described in the past as being 'the most violent game in the series, but ironically the game itself was not the source of complaints and controversy. The advertising for the game was much more controversial, and some of those who witnessed the adverts complained to advertising standards agencies. There were at least four ads for the game, and these ads featured slightly different taglines. The most controversial advert read 'Beautifully Executed', and featured a woman lying on a bed, apparently asleep. However, there was a bullet hole in her forehead, suggesting that it might be a <i>very</i> long sleep.</p><h2>HD Re-Release</h2><p>Hitman: Blood Money was re-released with high definition visuals as part of <a href=\"/hitman-hd-trilogy/3030-40084/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40084\">Hitman: HD Trilogy</a> on January 29, 2013.

The game's story explores topics including the nature of machine intelligence, morality, and free will. The puzzles are structured into independent challenge rooms that must be solved one after the next to progress through the game. Each puzzle tests spacial reasoning and involves manipulating doors, lasers, buttons, platforms, and more to find a way to reach the exit door. Typically every 10 puzzle rooms comprises a chapter, and between chapters are story sequences. There are 7 chapters total and each chapter has 1 optional challenge puzzle room, which if solved, yields extra insights into the game's story.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game takes place in the year 2250 at Jupiter's icy moon, <a href=\"/europa/3035-2983/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2983\">Europa</a>.

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The player controls an unnamed character - referred to as the \"brave one\" - through 51 levels to the top of the Dragon's Tower. At the top of the tower, the dark lord Drokmar possesses the Black Orb. The goal is to traverse the tower and stop Drokmar's plan to rule the world with the power of the magic crystal. There are two endings to the game - the ending depends on whether the player embraces or destroys the Black Orb.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is primarily a hack and slash sidescroller but also includes platforming in the form of parallel paths of travel and avoiding ground hazards. As the player progresses, they'll encounter new swords that cause increased damage and have different magic attacks. Most swords are acquired immediately after a boss battle at the end of certain levels. Chests and doors can be opened to reveal items and allies respectively. However, some chests and doors are traps that release enemies or other hazards. Doors also require keys to open, which are collected and stored by the player. Only one ally can travel with the player character at a time, and has its own health and level associated with it. Allies level up with items or by passing over the same type of ally again. The game also features a level select option, allowing the player to skip to level 5, 9, 13, 22, 26, 30, or 33.</p><h3>Secrets</h3><p>Most levels have at least one hidden chest. A secret chest is invisible unless the player character has the Thief ally, crystal ball item, or they strike it with their sword to open it. Some levels have secret doors that warp the player one or more floors ahead when used. These doors can never be seen until activated.</p><h3>Version Differences</h3><p>The SNES version of the game removed some enemies from the game and moves one of the bosses to a different floor.

The bonus stage pits the character riding on a horse chasing after weaving stage couch where someone in the back hurls prizes towards the screen. The player can collect more than one star per level, but the bonus stage can only be done once.

It was created by Hudson Soft in 1993 and has a single- and multi-player mode.

The areas typically consist of permanent blocks and destructible blocks, in various colors and styles, with half a dozen standard enemies or a larger <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a> enemy.

Allows for chain reactions.</li><li>Extra range: Incrementally increases the distance the flames from where the bombs travel, potentially up to the whole width of the area.</li><li>Maximum range: Gives the full flame range in one power-up.</li><li>Super bombs: Allows the flame from bombs to pass through destructible blocks as it destroys them.</li><li>Punch: Allows Bomberman to punch a placed bomb, sending it bouncing over walls into areas otherwise unreachable.</li><li>Kick: Allows Bomberman to kick a placed bomb, sending it rolling in one direction until it hits a wall.</li><li>Invincibility: Makes the player invulnerable. Allows a technique of continually dropping bombs into existing flame, creating a constant flame around the player as they walk.</li><li>Remote bombs: Allows the player to place bombs and then press another button to detonate them, allowing for traps to be laid far easier.</li><li>Rollerskates: Gives the player increased movement speed.</li><li>Wall Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through destructible blocks.</li><li>Bomb Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through bombs that have been placed - reduces chances of being trapped.</li><li>Time increase: In Story Mode, increases the amount of time the players has to clear any given stage.</li><li>Extra Life: In Story Mode, grants the player an additional life.</li></ul><p>There also exists in the game a 'skull' power-up, that has a negative effect when picked up. It essentially prevents the player from planting any bombs for a certain length of time. This is contagious - if the player's Bomberman is touched by an enemy Bomberman who has this effect, they will be affected too.</p><h2>Story Mode</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-370931\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-370931\"><img alt=\"Stage 5 of Story Mode\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8812/370931-gfs_59726_2_7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Stage 5 of Story Mode</figcaption></figure><p>The campaign in Super Bomberman can be played by a single player as just White Bomberman, or co-operatively with 2P as Black Bomberman. Care should be taken as players bombs can kill each other.</p><p>The story is set in Peace Town located in Diamond City which is Bomberman's hometown. Two villains, Carat Diamond and Dr. Mook, were holding a robot tournament to see which robots were the strongest. They then decided to kidnap Bomberman using a fake Bomberman to steal his technology with the aim of using this knowledge in a robot tournament. Black Bomberman knew what was happening and went on his own to head out and take out this fake robot. He fails and at the same time, his castle was taken from him. Black Bomberman warns White Bomberman of the threat, and together they try and defend Peace Town and defeat the evil robot Bombermen.</p><p>There are 6 themed worlds consisting of 8 stages and a boss fight. The exit from one stage to the next can be found by destroying the destructible blocks. It can only be entered once all enemies have been defeated. Discovering the exit early on can prove a disadvantage, as hitting it with the flame from a bomb causes more enemies to emerge from it. The 5th stage takes the form of a gladiatorial battle with a series of robot Bombermen who each enter the arena in turn.</p><p>Each stage features enemies with different abilities. Some examples of this are:</p><ul><li>Chameleons that change appearance to look exactly like White or Black Bombermen (potentially disastrous in co-op!)</li><li>Enemies with springs for legs that can pass over walls.</li><li>Enemies that disappear into tunnels and re-appear in other areas of the stage.</li><li>Blue ball creatures that are attracted to and eat bombs placed near to them, preventing them from exploding.</li><li>Tanks that shoot flames in random directions.</li><li>Enemy bombs that float about and then explode exactly as the player's bombs - damaging each other and the environment.</li></ul><p>The Story Mode uses a password system rather than writing a saved game file.</p><h2>Multiplayer Versus Mode</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7280/628739-bomberman1058.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628739\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7280/628739-bomberman1058.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628739\"><img alt=\"4 Player game with Punch, Kick and Rollerskate powerups visible.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7280/628739-bomberman1058.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7280/628739-bomberman1058.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>4 Player game with Punch, Kick and Rollerskate powerups visible.</figcaption></figure><p>Super Bomberman was the first <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> game to feature 4 player simultaneous play. Since the SNES only featured 2 controller ports, a multitap add-on was needed that plugged into the Player 2 slot, allowing more controllers to be connected. Four players could compete in the Battle Mode, in which each player started in one of the map corners and had to use their bombs to kill each other. There are also environmental threats to consider such as springs that send the player high into the air (see image).</p><p>Each game has a time limit of 2 minutes, and 1 hit kills each player. The last player standing wins a trophy, and the ultimate winner is decided by a series of games until 1 player wins a predefined number of trophies (1-5). Games are typically very hectic, but in the event of time running out the arena begins to shrink from the outside inward, crushing players who are caught under the falling blocks. If several players are still alive at the end, or if several die at the same time the game is considered a draw and no trophies are awarded.</p><h3>Stages</h3><p>Each of the stages (except for Normal Zone) has something unique:</p><ol><li>Normal Zone</li><li>Western Zone - All players are in center box.</li><li>Bomb Zone - Bombs are thrown into the stage.</li><li>Jump Zone - There are springs on the stage so when a player jumps on one, they land in a random place in the stage.</li><li>Belt Zone - A conveyor belt is placed in a box shape in the center.</li><li>Tunnel Zone - Tunnels are placed which is perfect for hiding bombs to blast unsuspected players.</li><li>Duel Zone - Only power-ups are surrounding the area and all players are trapped in soft blocks. They must to escape to claim all the power-ups.</li><li>Flower Zone - All the flowers are soft blocks and once they are blown up, they are resurrected again.</li><li>Light Zone - The stage is darkened but a light is shining and moves across the stage.</li><li>Power Zone - All players have been powered up with no soft blocks in the stage.</li><li>Warp Zone - 5 teleporters are placed on the stage and once the player lands on one, they rotate around the teleporters.</li><li>Speed Zone - All players move really fast.</li></ol><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 9,9,9 and 9 in addition to being awarded the Platinum Editor's Choice and Game of the Month. They stated, \"...one of the most addictive games since Tetris...One of the best party games around! .. offers all the fun of of the original Bomberman and really spices it up with loads of new power-ups and a huge variety of techniques.

The current ruler is an evil fighter known as Anubis, a position he gained by killing many people.</p><p>Mike Anderson, the player's partner, lost his father during Anubis's ascent to power and has dedicated his life to training himself until he was strong enough to defeat Anubis. However, to even get the chance to fight Anubis, the player (as the ST's gunner) and Mike must fight through all of Anubis's Battle Chiefs, each of whom controls a region of the world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The STs fight one-on-one, and with only the most basic of rules: the object is to destroy the other ST before it destroys the player's. This is accomplished by shooting the other ST (with the <a href=\"/super-scope/3055-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-470\">Super Scope</a> peripheral), while at the same time shooting its projectiles before they hit the player.</p><p>The gun works in a rapid-fire mode, where the player can simply hold down the first button, or it can be charged to shoot energy bolts. These energy bolts can only be fired when the energy bar has been filled up, and the bar is drained after each shot. The bar charges whenever the player is not shooting, so going for an energy bolt can be a risky maneuver. However, it is important to note that some of the opponents' attacks can only be deflected by an energy bolt.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1562320\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1562320\"><img alt=\" Attack its weak point for massive damage!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Attack its weak point for massive damage!\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75011/1562320-battle_clash_0013.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Attack its weak point for massive damage!</figcaption></figure><p>Because Mike Anderson is the ST's driver, every battle in this game is like most boss battles in <a href=\"/on-rails/3015-169/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-169\">on-rails shooters</a>. Damage done depends on where the shot lands, with each ST having some sort of weak point. Energy bolts do more damage, but as noted above, are riskier propositions. Also, it is important to realize that there is a 10-minute time limit on each battle at which point the player loses, regardless of the respective health bars of the STs.</p><p>As a point of strategy, it is worth noting that the STs take localized damage. If the player destroys one of the opponents weapons, it won't be able to fire, or if the rocket boosters are destroyed, it won't be able to fly. This allows for a good bit of strategic variety in how the player approaches any given battle.</p><p>The game also supplies minor power-ups, of which the player may have four at any given time. These include things like increased accuracy, a variety of bombs, and a variety of shield upgrades.</p><p>As the gunner in the ST, the player is freed from most details about movement.

To move the monkey, you tilt the platform the monkey is sitting on. The ultimate aim is to get your monkey through a goal at the end of a course within a certain period of time. You obtain score based on how much time you have left at the end of the level, and how many bananas you collected during it. The game has a very nice difficulty curve, starting at being easy enough for a five year old, and finally progressing to extremely hard levels. The game makes it very obvious that the bananas used are <a href=\"http://www.dole.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dole</a>.</p><h2>Story Mode</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10359/392596-monkey11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392596\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10359/392596-monkey11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392596\"><img alt=\"Going to hit that switch?\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10359/392596-monkey11.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10359/392596-monkey11.jpg 400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10359/392596-monkey11.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Going to hit that switch?</figcaption></figure><p>The evil <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3317\" href=\"/dr-bad-boon/3005-3317/\" slug=\"dr-bad-boon\">Dr. Bad-Boon</a> has stolen all of the bananas from the island that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-690\" href=\"/aiai/3005-690/\" slug=\"aiai\">AiAi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2445\" href=\"/meemee/3005-2445/\" slug=\"meemee\">MeeMee</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2447\" href=\"/gongon/3005-2447/\" slug=\"gongon\">GonGon</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2446\" href=\"/baby/3005-2446/\" slug=\"baby\">Baby</a> live on.

The player is given a set number of levels to complete within a set number of lives. Also, some levels have multiple goals that will allow the player to skip levels. There are four difficulty levels-- Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Master. Beginner has 10 levels, Advanced has 30, and Expert has 50. If all of the levels in a difficulty are completed without losing all lives, there are 10 extra, more difficult, levels to play.

In bowling, each character has it's own strengths and weaknesses. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-690\" href=\"/aiai/3005-690/\" slug=\"aiai\">AiAi</a> is all around. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2445\" href=\"/meemee/3005-2445/\" slug=\"meemee\">MeeMee</a> has the best curve. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2447\" href=\"/gongon/3005-2447/\" slug=\"gongon\">GonGon</a> has the fastest bowl. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2446\" href=\"/baby/3005-2446/\" slug=\"baby\">Baby</a>'s bowls are the easiest to aim.</p><h3>Monkey Golf 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405290\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.59375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-405290\"><img alt=\"Monkey Golf\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Monkey Golf\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4122/405290-monkey_golf.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Monkey Golf</figcaption></figure><p>Monkey Golf 2 is mainly a normal 18 hole golf course with some extra crazy thrown in Monkey style.</p><p><b>The rest of the games are locked at the start, and must be bought using play points.</b></p><h3>Monkey Boat</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449453\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75157232704403\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449453\"><img alt=\"Monkey Boat\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" data-width=\"318\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg 318w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Monkey Boat\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4122/449453-monkey_boat.jpg 318w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" data-width=\"318\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Monkey Boat</figcaption></figure><p>This is like monkey race but it boats.

As the batter, you can move around in the batters box and swing at the pitch. The outfield wall has many different compartments in it. Which compartment the ball rolls to is how many bases the batter runs. There are also ramps scattered throughout the field that count as home runs if the batter hits one. When the pitcher throws, he can keep changing the speed or direction of the ball until the batter hits it. He also gets to control the outfield when the batter hits the ball. If someone in the outfield catches the ball before it gets to a compartment it is an out.</p><h3>Monkey Tennis</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\"

title screen (USA version)</figcaption></figure><p>Luigi's Mansion is a horror-themed action-adventure game and was one of the launch titles for the Nintendo GameCube. It was released on November 17, 2001 in North America; on September 14, 2001 in Japan; and on May 3, 2002 in Europe. Luigi's Mansion was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. It focuses on <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>'s mission to clear a haunted mansion, that he 'won' in a contest he didn't enter, of ghosts to save Mario from their clutches. To do so, he hooks up with <a href=\"/professor-e-gadd/3005-1776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1776\">Professor E. Gadd</a>, who gives him a special vacuum, called the \" <a href=\"/poltergust-3000/3055-599/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-599\">Poltergust 3000</a>\", and a special Game Boy, called the <a href=\"/game-boy-horror/3055-1266/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1266\">Game Boy Horror</a>, to help with the job.</p><p>Despite its short length, Luigi's Mansion was received relatively well, and sold over 2.5 million copies. Due to this, Luigi's Mansion was later released as a Player's Choice title (and was one of the first title to be granted this status).</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Luigi's Mansion takes place in a large mansion, just outside of a creepy forest. The game opens with <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> exiting said forest to arrive at the mansion. Upon heading inside, Luigi encounters a bunch of ghosts and a mysterious scientist who attempts to save him with a mysterious device. Upon fleeing from the mansion, the scientist is found to be Professor E. Gadd, who lives near the mansion because he has been studying it. Explaining how he won the mansion in a contest he didn't enter, Luigi finds that his brother, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>, went into the mansion and hasn't come out. E. Gadd equips him with a special ghost-hunting vacuum, called the \" <a href=\"/poltergust-3000/3055-599/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-599\">Poltergust 3000</a>\", and sends him to clear the mansion of ghosts, and to rescue Mario.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Luigi's Mansion has Luigi hunting through a large mansion to save his brother, armed with a vacuum and a special Game Boy. To capture ghosts, Luigi must first make the ghost show their heart. This is accomplished by shining Luigi's flashlight on the ghost, appropriately stunning the ghost, and allowing Luigi to suck them in with the Poltergust, his vacuum.</p><h3>The Poltergust 3000</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338639\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81923076923077\" data-width=\"260\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 260px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338639\"><img alt=\"Luigi Fighting a Ghost\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></a><figcaption>Luigi Fighting a Ghost</figcaption></figure><p>The process of sucking them doesn't happen in an instant, and the ghost can fight back; Luigi has to keep pulling them in until their health hits zero, then they'll be sucked into the vacuum for all time. The ghosts can remain in the vacuum, but the 'boss ghosts' are put into portraits that go up in E. Gadd's gallery. Boss ghosts are extracted from the vacuum at the end of every area Luigi completes. The Poltergust can also be upgraded with medallions as the game goes on, allowing Luigi to shoot fire, ice, and water instead of just blowing air. This is used to complete puzzles, and can also be used as a weapon.</p><h3>The Game Boy Horror</h3><p>The special Game Boy is known as the Game Boy Horror. Luigi can use it to research items in the mansion, contact E. Gadd, navigate using its map, look at items, and even check if a Boo is in a room. The Game Boy Horror will also tell Luigi what room he has the door-key to on the map, making it easier to navigate. Additionally, if Luigi uses the Game Boy Horror to scan any of the mirrors in the mansion they will warp him back to the foyer, providing a convenient short cut when needing to save game progress with Toad.</p><h3>The Mansion</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844499\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844499\"><img alt=\"Luigi creeps up to the mansion.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Luigi creeps up to the mansion.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Luigi creeps up to the mansion.</figcaption></figure><p>The mansion itself is full of many surprises. It stays in the dark most of the time, unless Luigi clears a room of ghosts. Many rooms when completely cleared will also have treasure chests or keys, allowing Luigi to continue his search of the mansion. The mansion is five floors in all, including a basement and the roof, with the player starting in the foyer. Each floor has a boss to defeat, and certain objectives must be completed to reach the next floor.</p><p>Once the player has beaten the game, Luigi will use the money he's earned over the course of the game to build a new mansion in place of the old one. The size and grade of the mansion depends on how much money Luigi made over the course of the game.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Money</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rank A</td><td>100,000,000G +</td></tr><tr><td>Rank B</td><td>70,000,001G - 99,999,999G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank C</td><td>60,000,001G - 70,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank D</td><td>50,000,001G - 60,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank E</td><td>40,000,001G - 50,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank F</td><td>20,000,001G - 40,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank G</td><td>5,000,001G - 20,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank H</td><td>5,000G - 5,000,000G</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Ghost Gallery</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2301755\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2301755\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Professor E.Gadd has a gallery of ghost portraits in his workshop, unfortunately they all escaped when King Boo let them free. As Luigi catches the portrait ghosts they will be turned back into portraits using E.Gadd's Ghost Portrificationizer.

This only effects a small portion of the ending sequence. Also, the Hidden Mansion is unlocked. What the Hidden Mansion is depends on the player's version of the game. Bosses may be switched, the entire Mansion may have been mirrored, there may be more ghosts, or maybe even faster Boos; but, it all depends on the player's version of the game.</p>", "deck": "Luigi's Mansion is a Gamecube launch title that features Luigi as the main character as opposed to his more famous sibling.

Pok\u00e9mon Emerald was generally well-received, with critics praising Emerald for having longer and more challenging gameplay, improved graphics, and new features. Some critics disliked the fact that the game seemed to be more of a \"director's cut\" than an all-new game.

The game is played like any other traditional Pok\u00e9mon game. There are three modes in the game: the overworld, battle screen, and menu. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\" href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" slug=\"overworld\">overworld</a> is a top-down viewpoint, where the player can control either May or Brendan, interacting with people and objects. Also in the overworld, the player can trigger battles (either with wild Pok\u00e9mon or other Pok\u00e9mon trainers). These battles differ. Wild Pok\u00e9mon can be captured (although their hit points must be low enough to be capture) by throwing a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-425\" href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" slug=\"poke-ball\">Pok\u00e9 Ball</a> (or its varying types). Trainer battles don't have this option to capture their Pok\u00e9mon, as the goal is to merely make their Pok\u00e9mon faint. In battle, the player has the option to either fight, use an item, switch out Pok\u00e9mon, or run away (which can't be done in trainer battles). Fighting gathers all of the Pok\u00e9mon in a trainer's party to gain experience points, and even points triggers a level up.

While Ninja Gaiden and Shadow Warriors (the European version) are identical, Ninja Ryukenden differs in a few minor ways. There are many differences in music between the versions, but the only track that is completely different is one that is played during the Grand Canyon level. In addition, enemies in Ninja Gaiden need to hit the player much less to do damage, while in Ninja Ryukenden enemies must preform multiple hit combos to do damage. In Ninja Ryukenden, a voice can be heard saying Ninja Ryukenden at the end of the game, while nothing can be heard in Ninja Gaiden.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/461430-gaiden.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-461430\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/461430-gaiden.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-461430\"><img alt=\"The game over screen is notoriously grim\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/461430-gaiden.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/461430-gaiden.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The game over screen is notoriously grim</figcaption></figure><p>Taking place in the United States, Ninja Gaiden follows an unnamed ninja protagonist who is traveling through various locations across the United States, fighting a descendant of Nostradamus who leads a cult.</p><p>As a traditional beat-em-up, the player takes control of the nameless ninja.

If the player stops moving, the clones freeze in place, whether on the ground or in mid-air.

Like many of those competitors, Sparkster is a 2D platformer starring an anthropomorphic animal. The twist in this game is Sparkster's rocket pack, which can be used to fly around the level in eight directions for short bursts. Sparkster's quality and pedigree as a Konami game helped ensure it would be more memorable than <a href=\"/bubsy/3005-334/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-334\"> Bubsy</a> or <a href=\"/aero-the-acro-bat/3030-19337/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19337\"> Aero the Acro-Bat</a> ever were.</p><p>Sparkster is not to be confused with <a href=\"/sparkster-rocket-knight-adventures-2/3030-21235/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21235\">Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2</a>, which was a direct sequel to the original Rocket Knight Adventures exclusive to the Genesis/Mega Drive. The US/EU version of Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is known as just Sparkster, making it easy to confuse with this SNES spin-off.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Sparkster controls like a typical 2D platformer. Many areas feature thin ledges that can be grabbed by Sparkster's prehensile tail and climbed around on. A regular attack with the sword also launches a projectile across the screen, and holding down the button after attacking will charge the rocket pack, which takes about a second. Once charged, holding a direction and releasing the button will send Sparkster shooting away. While dashing with the rocket pack Sparkster will ricochet wildly off walls, floors and ceilings, which is sometimes the only way to reach a certain area. Sparkster can also use a flip move by pressing the R and L buttons, which will cause Sparkster to quickly flip right or left. This can be done in mid air and is a great way to get around, but using it too many times in a row makes Sparkster dizzy and unable to move for a while.</p><p>In addition, Sparkster has a few unique levels that switch up the gameplay. There's a level where Sparkster pilots giant mechanical ostriches, which run automatically. He can fire ripple laser shots from the bird's mouth and make it go up and down to grab crystals as it speeds by. Towards the end of the game, there is a section where the player controls the game as a top-down shooter. That level's boss fight involves piloting a fighting mech, which is controlled by pressing the R and L buttons to punch with the respective hand.</p>", "deck": "Sort of a spin-off game to the Genesis game known as Rocket Knight Adventures.

The game contains seven worlds which have three levels each. Progress is made by scrolling your character from left to right and up and down the levels.

The game does not follow several of the key gameplay elements to franchises such as <strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong>, as enemies cannot be defeated by jumping on them, rather the player must hit the enemy with a thrown item.</p> <p><strong><h2>Story</h2></strong></p> <p>Mickey Mouse surprises Minnie Mouse with a present. However, Pete, who usually attempts to foil Mickey's plans, successfully steals the present, causing Mickey to chase after Pete. Goofy and Minnie tag along, as Goofy usually tells the player where Pete is headed next, while Minnie offers words of encouragement.</p> <p><strong><h2>Gameplay</h2></strong></p> <p>Mickey Mouse is game's main character, with players navigating Disney's mascot through a variety of stages, meeting Goofy at the ending of each stage. Picking up square blocks scattered throughout the level, and correctly timing and aiming a throw will cause enemies to fly off the screen accompanied by a zooming sound effect.\u00a0</p> <p>The game also does not rely on heavy use of the Disney brand, as each level is either a generic Town, Woods, or Mountain. Enemies are also generic for the most part, aside from familiar styled pit bulls and weasels. Mickey faces against adversaries that are themed with the current level, as spiders appear in a haunted mansion, and flying squirrels attack Mickey while in the Woods.</p> <p>In addition to the platforming levels, Mickey also uses a few vehicles to catch up to Pete, such as a motorboat and an automobile. During these stages, the screen autoscrolls, forcing Mickey to avoid certain obstacles in a limited amount of time, while also successfully navigating the level. Certain birds can also give Mickey a ride, allowing the player to hop from bird to bird in a vertical progression down a mountainside.</p> <p>Players begin each levels with three hearts in the health meter, allowing for multiple hits before Mickey must restart the level. White heart cards replenish health, while cards displaying the silhouette of Mickey Mouse gain the player extra lives. Each level also has four hidden orbs, and when each is found, Goofy will reward the player with extra lives.</p> <p>Puzzle elements are found in the Intustrial Zone stages, where blocks must be picked up in a specific order if Mickey is to successfully navigate the floor-spiked warehouse.\u00a0</p>", "deck": "In this game you can play as Mickey or Minnie Mouse as they pick up blocks in 2-D levels.

The goal of the game is to \"capture\" certain blocks whilst avoid being crushed by the blocks themselves. There are ten levels in the game, each level consisting of four sets of blocks to capture.</p><p>The most basic method of capturing a cube is by tapping the X button. This lays down a blue marker on the square that the player is standing on. When a cube rolls on top of the marker the player can capture the cube by tapping the X button again. Once captured, the cube is removed from the playing field. Only one marker can be placed at a time.</p><p>Another method of capturing cubes is by detonating green markers by capturing the \"Advantage Cube\". This is explained in greater detail in the next section.</p><h2>The Blocks</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1325510\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62479608482871\" data-width=\"613\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 613px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1325510\"><img alt=\"Blocks!\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg 613w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28528/1325510-green3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Blocks!</figcaption></figure><p>Although the basic gameplay is rather simple, Intelligent Qube makes it more complex by layering different mechanics on top of each other. Varying speeds that the blocks move at, more blocks to capture but more importantly; different types of blocks that can help or hinder the player. There are three types of blocks to encounter.</p><ul><li>Basic Cube - The most basic block that can be found in all the levels. To progress further in the game the player must capture all of these blocks. Should any of these blocks fall off the platform, the player would lose a mark on the \"Block Count\". If the number of the basic blocks exceed the limit, the player would lose the last row of blocks. Giving them less space to work with. This block can vary in color depending on the level but its behavior is no different.</li><li>Advantage Cube - This bright green block can help the player capture the blocks more efficiently and quickly. When one of these blocks are captured, it leaves a green marker in its place. By tapping the Triangle button, the green marker detonates and captures all the blocks within the 3x3 area. Multiple advantage cubes can be captured but all of the advantage markers can only be detonated at the same time as well. By carefully capturing these blocks and detonating them at the right time. The player can capture mulitple blocks at one time, allowing for a higher score. Advantage Cubes can also capture Forbidden Cubes so careful placement is needed. These cubes also count towards the Block Count if they fall off the field.</li><li>Forbidden Cubes - These black cubes are dangerous for if the player does capture these blocks in whatever fashion, the player loses the last row of cubes from the playing field. These blocks do not count towards the Block Scale when they fall off the field thus they should be left alone.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1099848\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2240663900415\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1099848\"><img alt=\"More Blocks\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg 241w\"><noscript><img alt=\"More Blocks\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/1099848-iq_image3_1134522451.jpg 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" data-width=\"241\"></noscript></a><figcaption>More Blocks</figcaption></figure><p>Should the character be crushed by any of these blocks they will be paralyzed and the game automatically fast-forwards until all the cubes from the current set fall off the field. The player is then forced to retry that set again. If the character is standing on the last row of cubes and they are removed, the character falls off and the entire level must be started again.</p><p>If the player successfully removes all the Basic Cubes and Advantage Cubes from a set without capturing the Forbidden Cubes, the player is awarded with a \"Perfection Score\" with an extra row of cubes at the end of the playing field. This is important as the later levels of the game require more space to work with.</p><p>By beating the game numerous times new characters are unlocked: Cynthia and Spike the dog. These characters move faster then the default character Eliot.</p><h2>Scoring</h2><ul><li>For each individual cube that is captured, the player gains 100 Points.</li><li>For each cube that is captured with an Advantage Cube, the player gains 200 Points. The player also gains 200 Points if they capture a cube using the basic method so long that they capture it at the same time they detonate the green marker.</li><li>When the game ends, the game multiplies each remaining row of the level by 1,000 Points. So if the player has ten rows remaining, the player is awarded with 10,000 Points.</li></ul><h2>Music</h2><p>The soundtrack was composed by <a href=\"/takayuki-hattori/3040-97871/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97871\">Takayuki Hattori</a>. The orchestral score had a more chilling aspect to it as opposed to the standard upbeat track found in most puzzle games. It was well received and it was eventually released under Sony Music by the title of \"IQ Final Perfect Music File\" in 1999.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Intelligent Qube was well received and sold about 750,000 copies in 1997.

However during flight, the flutter experiences turbulence, which causes them to crash land on the island, called Kattelox. Megaman is now charged with the task of repairing the flutter so the Casket family can return to sailing the skies searching for more treasures.</p><p>Once you leave the Flutter a police car comes screeching to Megamans location in order to investigate the crash.

The player explores 'digs' sites in which Mega Man just venture into Ruins to find parts that will help restore his ship and get them off the crashed island. Upon exploring these ruins the player will come across many different items that help power-up Mega Man in different ways. The main thing the player will come across will be \"Zenny\", which the currency used in the Mega Man franchise, as well as many other games with Japanese origins. Zenny comes in the form of crystals that are dropped when enemies are defeated and certain objects are destroyed. Zenny can be used in the towns market to buy items like Health upgrades, buster parts and other power-ups.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Mega Man has a fully customizable Bustergun and Secondary weapons. The Bustergun can be upgraded in terms of Range, Power, Energy and Rapid through the use of \"Buster parts\", which are bought from the Market and found in ruins and side missions.</p><ul><li>Range- distance from Mega Man the shots will travel.</li></ul><ul><li>Power- overall attack value afflicted on enemies. The shots develop from small orange pellets to large blue ones.</li></ul><ul><li>Energy- the number of successive shots the buster gun can shoot. Start from three and stops in a never-ending stream.</li></ul><ul><li>Rapid- the speed at which the shots travel.</li></ul><p>Roll can provide backup using the \u2018Support Van\u2019, which she found and restored outside town. She gives Mega Man a walkie-talkie that he can use in any part of the town to take him elsewhere. While inside, Mega Man can save by talking and get healed from Data. Roll can use the van to provide Mega Man with information on his next objective, as well as Upgrade and change secondary weapons.</p><p>And Mega Man also has a number of these secondary weapons at his disposal. Parts procured around town and through missions and stores can be taken to Roll to create powerful and varied weapons from Trip Mines to Laser Beams and are effective in a number of different situations. Secondary weapons can be upgraded but cost Roll Zenny to make. While these upgrades change from weapon to weapon, they usually lead to increased attack power and energy. Mega Man can only have 1 secondary weapon equipped, and can only switch them up in the support van.</p><p>Mega Man can upgrade his gear by finding a helmet, buying new Armors for increasing protection and building shoes that allow Mega Man to jump higher or skate about town.</p><h3>A Living City</h3><p>Kattelox is more than simply a setting for the events of the plot. At its center is a town bustling with life. Citizens, police and vehicles populate the town. Mega Man can enter the library, give antiques to the local museum, enter the TV station and participate in televised challenges and help a local gang of kids find, fix and furnish a clubhouse. During the course of the game, Mega Man will also acquire citizenship and gain access to more areas of the city. While this is merely a way of focusing the player into the events at hand, the sheer number of activities could have been too much to have open at the beginning.</p><ul><li>Apple Market- Kettelox's shopping arcade. No Citizen Card required! Put litter in its place.</li><li>Downtown- residential and commercial zone. Go to the library or play in the streets and get hit by one of its many cars.</li><li>City Hall- with the mayor's office and police station, this is the political backbone of Kettelox.</li><li>Uptown- this beautiful area is the artistic and cultural center of the city and is home to the Kettelox TV station, museum, Hospital and harbor.</li><li>Old City- filled with the remnants of the cities industrial past, Old City has seen better days and fewer packs of stray dogs.</li></ul><p>What really makes things interesting is the larger effect Mega Man has on the city itself. Several battles take place inside city limits, and the buildings become collateral. The player is given the opportunity to invest Zenny into paying construction fees. Over the course of the game, larger containers will appear on destroyed building as they're repaired and the city will be revived allowing more side missions, each more varied than the last.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>The control configuration is fairly bog standard for a 3D action game. Mega Man can jump and shoot but the mapping of character orientation to L1 and R1 allow for advanced movement options. While the game was one of the first to enable an enemy lock-on, it wasn't as versatile as 'Z-targeting' made famous by The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, released the same year; Mega Man can't move while targeting. Running while using the shoulder buttons was a close approximation to circle-strafing but didn't come with any of the disorientation that came from moving outwards in relation to being locked onto a single enemy.</p><h3>Level Design</h3><p>Most plot progression comes from completing various dig sites spread across Kattelox. These tend to be small-scale, linear dungeons that are far simpler than anything from the Legend of Zelda games of the time. Each of these dungeons are accessible when the player reaches plot-related events in the story such as acquiring the boat and patching up the Flutter.</p><p>All dwarf in comparison to what at first appears to be small ruins spread across the island. Initially nothing more than small diversions that leads to Zenny and items, each section flow into the others and forms a larger labyrinth that allows travel between most main locations on Kattelox when Mega Man acquires items such as the Spring Boots and Drill Arm, allowing him to reach higher platforms and destroy certain walls.</p><h3>Animation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1553628\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 259px\" data-ratio=\"0.74903474903475\" data-width=\"259\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1553628\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" data-width=\"259\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg 259w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61840/1553628-images.jpg 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" data-width=\"259\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Special mention goes to the character models and animation. Sporting design that appears proto cel-shaded, the graphics are anime-inspired two years before Fear Effect debuted and Jet Grind Radio hit the streets. Besides possessing more fluid movement and physical articulation than what was reasonably expected from a PlayStation era title, Mega Man Legends features rich facial animations that allowed characters an extensive range of expressions. Unlike most games of the time, dialogue accompanied emotions that were more than full-body pantomime. Here, small twitches of the mouth, shifts of the eyes and the resulting shadows add to every scene.</p><p>Capcom References</p><ul><li>The owner of the boat looks suspiciously similar to the original Mega Man's arch-nemesis, Dr. Wily.</li></ul><ul><li>Reference to Resident Evil.</li></ul><h2>Facts about the Game</h2><ul><li>Mega Man Legends marks the first time Capcom tried a 3D Mega Man game.</li></ul><ul><li>Although never explicitly stated in-game, according to the official Capcom sourcebook Rockman Perfect Memories, the Legends series takes place far, far into the future of the Mega Man Timeline.

The basic gameplay centers on rolling a round object called a <a href=\"/katamari/3055-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-29\">katamari</a> (literally translated as \"clump\") with the ability to pick up other objects smaller than itself in order to grow bigger; once the katamari is large enough, it is launched into space and becomes a <a href=\"/star/3055-1818/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1818\">star</a> or other celestial object. Katamari Damacy is notable for its bright, simple aesthetic and the quirkiness of its gameplay mechanics, as well as its whimsical story and eccentric characters.</p><p>The core concept for Katamari Damacy originated from its director <a href=\"/keita-takahashi/3040-89724/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89724\">Keita Takahashi</a>, who began developing the game as a student project. After Katamari's initial release, it received acclaim for its unique gameplay and became a cult hit. The original game went on to spawn a long-running <a href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-402\">franchise</a>; however, Takahashi would only continue as the series' director for one sequel, <a href=\"/we-love-katamari/3030-18373/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18373\">We Love Katamari</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/10777-katamari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10777\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/10777-katamari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10777\"><img alt=\"The Prince and The King. \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/10777-katamari.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/10777-katamari.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></a><figcaption>The Prince and The King. </figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/king-of-all-cosmos/3005-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-425\">The King of all Cosmos</a> has destroyed every star in the night sky by means of an inebriated rampage through space. He has tasked his son, <a href=\"/the-prince/3005-944/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-944\">the Prince</a>, to create new stars by using balls known as katamari. You take the role of the Prince and attempt to roll up as many items as you can so they can be used to create new starts.</p><p>The King appears often in game, and usually with humorous comments about life on earth. He refers to himself in third-person with liberal use of the royal \"We,\" and happens to have a voice that sounds like a record player being scratched. The King is larger then the Earth, and his sculpted body is clad in a tight black suit.</p><p>The game doesn't have a specific plot line, but the Prince must create stars to the King's specifications and doing so shall unlock new stages. The tiny Prince ends up getting tasked to rebuild the moon with help from the Hoshino family, who the Prince will come to know through the various <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The hub world, known as the Home Planet, serves as a way of checking what items the katamari has rolled up, what constellations the Prince has created (from completing certain stages which focus on a different task than usual) and allows the player to save the game and change various settings.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10382/546976-katamari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-546976\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10382/546976-katamari.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-546976\"><img alt=\"The Prince rolling a collection of items. \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10382/546976-katamari.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10382/546976-katamari.jpg 400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10382/546976-katamari.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Prince rolling a collection of items. </figcaption></figure><p>He can then float down to earth and start playing stages. In the story stages, the King will task you to create a katamari of a specific size or higher in a certain <a href=\"/time-limit/3015-753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-753\">time limit</a>. The earlier stages will have you rolling your katamari around houses, and then gradually you will move out into the open world by completing more stages, culminating in a stage where you have to create <a href=\"/the-moon/3035-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-10\">the Moon</a>.</p><p>There are also \"Constellation\" levels, where you have to do other activities rather than creating the biggest possible katamari. You may have to collect crabs to recreate the constellation of Cancer, or to find and roll up the largest <a href=\"/bear/3015-1848/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1848\">bear</a> possible to make Ursa Major, among many others.</p><p>The \"Eternal\" levels are stages in which you may roam around specific stages. There is no time limit, no size requirement, just the ability to make the katamari as big as possible and seeing the sights. You unlock these stages by getting a large score on levels 4, 8 and the \"Make a Moon\" stage.</p><p>Multiplayer is available in a competitive form. The players take control of either the Prince or one of his many cousins. They are placed in a small area of the game and compete to gather the most objects possible in a three minute time limit. They can bump pieces off the other player's katamari, which provides an advantage as you can collect the fallen objects.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>The game utilizes a dual-analog stick control system. The player has to push both analog sticks forward to move forward, both sticks to the right if they want to strafe right, etc. To turn, the user must either push just one stick forwards or backwards, or one stick forwards and the other backwards, which is faster than the former method. If one pressed the left stick forward, the katamari will turn to the right, simulating the Prince's left hand pushing forward. The Prince can perform a 'spin dash' by rapidly moving both sticks forwards and backwards, which, similar to <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic</a>'s spin charge ability in his 2D games, gives the Prince a short boost of speed.</p><h3>Graphics</h3><p>Katamari Damacy utilizes a unique graphical style. It is very blocky and at times rough to look at, but critics and consumers alike praised its uniqueness, which allows the game to use bigger and more plentiful areas of gameplay, and was kept in the multiple sequels. The graphical choice reduces CPU and GPU load, allowing for faster load times and larger levels (although in some of the later levels there are loading screens when the katamari is big enough to progress to a new area).</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The unique soundtrack, primarily composed by <a href=\"/yuu-miyake/3040-95527/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-95527\">Yuu Miyake</a> was loved by critics, who applauded its mix of electronica, country and soft rock.</p><h3>Track Listing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575160\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575160\"><img alt=\"Katamari Damacy Official Soundtrack.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Katamari Damacy Official Soundtrack.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3509/575160-katamari_damacy_cd.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Katamari Damacy Official Soundtrack.</figcaption></figure><p>Name: <i>Katamari Fortissimo Damacy</i>Total length: 75:14</p><ol><li>\"Nananan Katamari\" -

Melee is a fighting game published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> for the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> on November 21, 2001 and then a few weeks later on December 2, 2001. The game is the first of two sequels to the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>'s hit title, <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19125\">Super Smash Bros</a>. Melee sports a cast of 25 total characters, all of which originated in Nintendo franchises.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Melee was one of the GameCube's best selling titles. It was a huge financial success and one of the main games to boost the console's sale noticeably. Its main appeal derives from its large player base as well as being simple enough for many players to play. Following its release Melee was featured in many fighting game competitions such as EVO and MLG events.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Melee was developed by <a href=\"/hal-laboratory-inc/3010-753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-753\">HAL Laboratory</a>, with <a href=\"/masahiro-sakurai/3040-66996/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-66996\">Masahiro Sakurai</a> as the head of production. The game was one of the first games released on the Nintendo GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening <a href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">FMV</a> sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their <a href=\"http://www.hallab.co.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">official website</a>, the developers posted screen shots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor.</p><p>The game's soundtrack featured a large series of remixes and remakes of classic Nintendo tunes and some new ones as well.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2592999\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2592999\"><img alt=\"Rewarding Trophies\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82269/2592999-gale01-26.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Rewarding Trophies</figcaption></figure><p>The game plays in the same format of its <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19125\">predecessor</a>. A big part of the fighting is items, objects that have direct or indirect effects in battle. The way a player approaches this game can greatly differ with some players opting for crazy 4-player item matches and others choosing to have one on one fights on the more standard stages. Most of these originated from a previous Nintendo franchise which may or may not be represented in the game by a character. The actual game unfolds exactly like the earlier title, with it's percentage based system and knock-out of stage concept.</p><p>One of Melee's most acclaimed qualities is its large amount of playable modes. Default matches play out in Stock (a predetermined number of lives) or Time, where matches end when a certain time limit expires. Coin and Bonus battles are also available. In the former, players can earn coins by damaging other players, the one with the most coins prevails. In Bonus battles, players must try to gain bonuses, which grant points, by fighting with style or accomplishing different feats.</p><p>A number of single player modes are also introduced. Classic mode derives directly from the original <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19125\">Smash Bros</a>. The new Adventure mode, however, consists of a series of platform-style 2D stages, all of which represent multiple Nintendo franchises. For example, the first level is a basic side-scroller level designed to look like the classic <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros</a>. game with the same music and enemies.</p><h2>Changes from the original</h2><ul><li>Characters can now preform a <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a></li><li>Characters now have four throws and can pummel the opponent while holding a character in the throw</li><li>All characters now have a left/right special attack in addition to their original three</li><li>Characters can now <a href=\"/dodge/3015-2476/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">spot dodge</a> and <a href=\"/aerial-dodge/3015-2477/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2477\">air dodge</a></li><li>It is possible for characters with a ranged grab attack (such as Samus and Link) to grab onto the side of the stage when recovering</li><li>All characters can now move with a heavy item, whereas only <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a> could do this in the original</li><li>Smash attacks can now be charged by holding the \"A\" button, as well as quickly executed with a respective flick the the \"C\" stick</li><li>Stock matches now have an optional time limit</li><li>On occasions when breaking container items a common enemy from <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a>, <a href=\"/ice-climber/3030-13918/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13918\">Ice Climber</a> or <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Zelda</a> may pop out</li><li>The \"C\" stick can be used to change the camera angle while navigating the menu screens</li><li>The game moves at a much faster pace</li><li>Items can now be caught in mid-air after they've been thrown</li></ul><h2>Item List</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Franchise/Game</th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/party-ball/3055-381/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-381\">Party Ball</a></td><td>A container item that explodes with confetti and items, though on occasion it will contain bob-ombs or enemies.</td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/capsule/3055-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-402\">Capsule</a></td><td>A container that holds an item or an enemy, it can be thrown at your opponent to do damage.</td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/crate/3055-31/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-31\">Crate</a></td><td>A heavy container item that the player will struggle to walk with while holding, there is a small chance of enemies emerging.</td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/barrel/3055-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-82\">Barrel</a></td><td>A heavy container item, if a barrel is thrown to the side it will roll along the floor until it breaks.</td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/beam-sword/3055-365/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-365\">Beam Sword</a></td><td>A powerful weapon with a long reach, it is similar in appearance to a <a href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsaber.</a></td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/home-run-bat/3055-476/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-476\">Home-run Bat</a></td><td>A baseball bat that almost always kills your opponent when used with a fully charged smash attack.</td><td><a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros.</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/fan/3055-397/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-397\">Fan</a></td><td>Why is the fan awesome?

Melee's cinematic Intro</figcaption></figure><p>A new feature in this game is the addition of Trophies. Trophies (known as \"Figures\" in the Japanese version) are small replicas of various Nintendo characters and objects throughout history that can be collected throughout the game. These trophies include figures of playable characters, accessories, and items associated with them as well as secondary characters and properties not otherwise included in the game. The trophies range from the well-known to the obscure, and even characters or elements that were only released in Japan. The trophies include a description of the particular subject and detail the year and the game in which the subject first appeared. Super Smash Bros. had a similar system of plush dolls (Biographies); however, it only included the 12 playable characters.</p><p>There are 290 collectable trophies for the player to try and obtain in the American and European version of the game. There is a trophy menu that you can select; in this mode the player can gamble to try and win new trophies, a mode where the player can pose their trophies and a mode where they can look through all their collected trophies. The player can access the gallery to view all the trophies they have collected so far, a \"new\" tag will show up besides the recently collected. The trophy lottery allows the player to spend coins earned in the game to try and win new trophies. The collection mode allows the player to pose the trophies they have earned. The Japanese version of the game has some additional trophies but three of these can be gained in the American version through using Action Replay codes.</p><h2>Modes</h2><h3>Single Player</h3><p><b>Classic</b> - The successor to the 1 Player game in Super Smash Bros, players fight a string of battles with some random conditions (such as fighting Giant/Metal characters), interspersed with <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-games</a> such as Target Test and Snag the Trophies.

The player is tasked with making it to the end of character themed levels, such as the Hyrule dungeon crawl level, where you have the chance to beat up Like-Likes, Re-deads, and Octoroks. Players make it to different stages by completing the battles at the end of them. By meeting certain conditions, players may be allowed to participate in special battles (such as, against Giant Kirby or Giga Bowser).</p><p><b>All-Star</b> - Unlocked after acquiring every character. In this mode, the player must fight and defeat every character, with characters randomly teamed up to battle. Damage is not healed after each fight, it only heals when using one of the 3 <a href=\"/heart-container/3055-312/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-312\">heart containers</a> in the lobby area. Trophies occasionally appear in the lobby after a fight.</p><p><b>Event Matches</b> - In these specialized matches, players must meet specific conditions (such as collect 200 coins during the battle) or defeat special opponents (such as the cast of <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>). Only the first 10 are available to start, but up to 51 are unlockable by completing events and meeting certain conditions.

The methods for unlocking characters is quite varied, such as completing Classic mode a given amount of times, or reaching a certain number of Vs. matches. Some of the characters have very specific and unique methods for being unlocked. Whatever the method, before being unlocked and playable, each new character has to be defeated in a standard match. If the player fails to defeat the new character, he/she will simply be prompted to battle the next time the unlock conditions are fulfilled.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Playable Character</b></td><td><b>Series Origin</b></td><td><b>Attained</b></td><td><b>Recurring</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Mario</a> series</td><td>Intial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/pikachu/3005-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-145\">Pikachu</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a></td><td><a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Peach</a></td><td><a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a></td><td><a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Donkey Kong</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/captain-falcon/3005-1215/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1215\">Captain Falcon</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">F-Zero</a></td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/fox-mccloud/3005-418/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-418\">Fox</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Star Fox</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/ness/3005-789/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-789\">Ness</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Mother</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/ice-climbers/3005-928/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-928\">Ice Climbers</a></td><td><a href=\"/ice-climber/3030-13918/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13918\">Ice Climber</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\">Kirby</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Kirby</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Metroid</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Zelda</a>/<a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Sheik</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Zelda</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a></td><td><a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Zelda</a> series</td><td>Initial Roster</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/jigglypuff/3005-21143/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21143\">Jigglypuff</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a></td><td><a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td><td><b>O</b></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/marth/3005-547/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-547\">Marth</a></td><td><a href=\"///\">Fire Emblem</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/mewtwo/3005-6335/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6335\">Mewtwo</a></td><td><a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/mr-game-watch/3005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1488\">Mr. Game &amp; Watch</a></td><td><a href=\"/game-watch/3025-1183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\">Game &amp; Watch</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Mario</td><td><a href=\"///\">Dr. Mario</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/falco/3005-24783/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24783\">Falco</a></td><td><a href=\"/star-fox/3025-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-329\">Star Fox</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/ganon/3005-512/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-512\">Ganondorf</a></td><td><a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Zelda</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/pichu/3005-4466/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4466\">Pichu</a></td><td><a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pok\u00e9mon</a></td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/roy/3005-1520/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1520\">Roy</a></td><td><a href=\"/fire-emblem/3025-196/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-196\">Fire Emblem</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr><tr><td>Young Link</td><td><a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Zelda</a> series</td><td>Unlockable</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Initial Roster</h3><p>Super Smash Bros.

Marth handles more like a light characters with a shorter recovery whose main damage box is at the edge of his sword. Marth's Down B \"Counter\" attack is slightly faster than Roy's and always does 7% damage. Roy's \"Counter,\" on the other hand, takes a little more time to perform but does 1.5 times the damage of the opponents countered attack. Roy will take damage from his fully charged standard special move but has more of a potential for damage. Marth has much greater range than Roy due to his hit box being at the tip of his blade.</p><p><a href=\"/fox-mccloud/3005-418/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-418\">Fox</a> / <a href=\"/falco-lombardi/3005-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-420\">Falco</a>: Falco is more of a heavy character and a fast faller after using an aerial move. Good at ground combos leading into air combos into a spike. A slower laser gun but, being a little bit more powerful, slightly stuns the enemy. Fox is a light character who is arguably the fastest character in the whole game. He is extremely good at doing combos in the air leading to a shine off of the edge. Has a much faster laser which can be spammed repeatedly to keep enemies at a distance, but there is no stun from his blasts. Falco has a worse recovery with his Up B and Side B (Falco Phantasm) having a less range than Fox's respective moves. Another notable difference lies in the characters' Down Aerial. Fox's Down Aerial functions as a combo attack, hitting six or seven times and having little-to-no knockback, whereas Falco's Down Aerial is a single hit spike.</p><p><a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a> / Young Link: Link and Young Link don't have to many substantial differences; Young Link is lighter and thus faster than Link; Link is heavier and slower than Young Link. Given the difference in the size of their swords, Young Link has a slightly shorter range than Link in certain moves. Both have similar moves with slight aesthetic differences. Both have the ability to use their hookshot to grab onto ledges, but only Young Link has the ability to perform a wall jump technique and it is actually required in his target test stages. There main special move is different when activated on the ground in the Young Links version does less damage but does immediate knock-back, Link's version will trap his opponent in the spin before knocking them away. When Young Link taunts he will have a swig of tasty milk, where as Link will just summon <a href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\">Navi</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295399\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.33\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295399\"><img alt=\"Show me your moves!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Show me your moves!\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1295399-captainfalconmelee.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Show me your moves!</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/captain-falcon/3005-1215/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1215\">Captain Falcon</a> / <a href=\"/ganon/3005-512/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-512\">Ganondorf</a>: Captain Falcon is a fast light character and a fast faller. Falcon is fast enough to break into many combos and is an extremely good character for chain throws. Ganondorf is a heavy and slow moving character. Despite the fact that Ganondorf is slightly stronger than Falcon, Falcon is fast enough to gain the same damage from multiple moves as one of Ganondorfs powerful moves in about the same time. Ganondorf has an arguably better recovery due to the Down B trick. While recovering, both characters can use their mid-air jumps, followed by the Down B (Falcon Kick/Wizard's Foot) and recover their midair jump for further use. The difference in use lies in the great range of Falcon's Down B, causing him to lower his position a greater amount than Ganondorf's attack, making the trick more difficult to use than Ganondorf's.</p><p><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> / Dr. Mario: Both play extremely similarly with the only real differences being the after effect of each of their same moves. Both have the same exact speed and falling time, although Mario has <i>slightly</i> more range and slightly less power than the Doctor. Both have the same distance of recovery. Both of the characters can use their capes (Side B) to gain horizontal distance to the ledge and end with an up b recovery. Using the cape makes up for both characters' poor recovery. The two characters do have their differences, however subtle. For example: both characters have the same move set but Mario's ground A \"jab\" combo is faster than Dr. Mario's \"jab\" combo by about a quarter of a second and is only really noticeable when you have two controllers and are making both do the same moves at the same time. The first two attacks, punches, are perfectly timed but the third attack, a kick, sees Mario pulling ahead of the Doctor. This is a result of an extra few frames of Doctor putting his fist down after the second punch. Furthermore, Mario's and Dr. Mario's grounded Down B are the same attack with the same damage but, Mario's attack sends enemies launching straight up into the air while Dr. Mario's sends the enemies at an arc to either side of him. Mario's fireballs have a higher downward angle of trajectory from the hand than Dr. Mario's pills, the Doctor's pills deal random damage unlike Mario's fireballs. Bigger differences lie in the characters' aerial moves. Visually, Mario and Dr. Mario have the same Forward Aerial, but in practice, Mario's attack is a meteor smash whereas Dr. Mario's attack sends the opponent straight upward. Mario's Neutral Aerial reduces in damage and knock-back the longer it is out (which is the norm for similar ariel moves for other characters) while opposite is true for Dr. Mario's Neutral Aerial (unique to Dr. Mario). Both have similar cape attacks. These two are true clones with only mild differences and essentially a pallet swap to tell the two apart.</p><p><a href=\"/pikachu/3005-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-145\">Pikachu</a> / <a href=\"/pichu/3005-4466/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4466\">Pichu</a>: Following the trend of the clone characters, Pikachu is the heavier, stronger version of the character type, whereas Pichu is the lighter, weaker version. The most notable difference between the two is that Pichu hurts itself when using an electric attack, taking 1-4% of damage depending on the attack. This difference basically makes Pichu an inferior version of Pikachu. Its light weight coupled with its self-damaging attacks make Pichu much easier to KO than its evolved counterpart. Although the two have essentially the same moveset, other minor differences exist. Most of Pichu's attacks seem to be designed more around multi-hit combos whereas Pikachu's attacks are mainly one strong hit. Pichu's Forward Smash, for example, hits several times in a row and ends with strong knockback. Pikachu on the other hand, hits just once for high damage and knockback. Also note that Pikachu's Up B \"Quick Attack\" does damage (although minimal) to the opponent if it is in the path of movement, whereas Pichu passes harmlessly through the opponent.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Stages</h2><p>Super Smash Bros.

Luckily, Snake made it into <i>Brawl</i>.</li><li>The Smash Bros. team had development plans for Lucas, the star of the Game Boy Advance only release game <a href=\"///\">Mother 3</a>. As an inclusive part of Melee's character list, he would thus replace Ness from within the gameplay, but when Mother 3 was delayed until 2006 he was scratched from being a considerable replacement.</li><li>If you are playing as Fox or Falco on the Corneria or Venom stages you can activate a special taunt by pressing down on the d-pad for one frame of animation.

It is a very specific glitch that causes the turnip's that Peach throws to spark, flame, swirl and suck characters in and quickly do 999% damage to them. The glitch causes massive slowdown to the game and has been known to crash the Gamecube.</li><li>There is a glitch in the game that allows you to play as the master hand, the glitch involves having the controller in the third port and utilizing some button presses on the name entry screen. What is amazing about this glitch is that it was not actually discovered until seven years after the original release of the game.</li><li>After completing the classic mode you were treated to a game where you are piloting an arwing in a first person perspective while you try to blast away at the credits.

Melee received universal acclaim from critics and was praised for the numerous improvements it made to the formula of the original game as well as adding several brand new features. The visuals of the game got a great reception at the time of launch and it remains one of the best looking games on the Gamecube to this day. Melee's orchestrated soundtrack was also lauded for its nostalgic factor, incorporating the music of countless Nintendo classics. The game received an aggregate score 92 out of 100 on Metacritic and a 90.3 on GameRankings. Super Smash Bros. Melee is the best selling Gamecube game of all time with over 7 million copies sold, it was also the first Gamecube game to reach a million copies sold. It has also received numerous awards such as IGN's readers choice award for 2001, Gamespot's Gamecube game of the year and the Official Nintendo Magazine named it as 58th best Nintendo game of all time.</p><p>Melee was well received by high level fighting game fans and has been featured in the <a href=\"/major-league-gaming/3015-1858/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG</a> as well as represented at <a href=\"/evo-championship-series/3015-7054/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7054\">EVO</a> in 2007. The game has remained an active tournament game for over nine years. The game has remained popular with competitive players even after the release of <i>Brawl.</i> Ken Hoang is generally considered to be the best high level player of all time and has won over $50,000 from competing in various tournaments. The game was successful enough to spawn an inevitable and much anticipated sequel that was launched in 2008.</p><p> </p><h2>Glitches</h2><p>Super Smash Bros. Melee is a game that consists of many glitches. Some of them took years to find out while some where discovered almost immediately. Some can be performed on the spot by a single player while some others require the teamwork of four friends to fully achieve. This is a list of some of the more iconic glitches from Melee.</p><h3>Wavedashing</h3><p>Wavedashing is a core mechanic that you will see if you watch any professional Smash Melee at all. It is something that wasn't originally intended to be in the game but is technically the cause of a glitch. While this is probably the most common glitch it is often overlooked as one and has not been widely accepted as a feature of the game despite the fact that its roots are from a bug in the air dodge system.</p><p>In Melee all characters can do an air dodge while in the air by pressing L or R. When in airdodge mode a character is completely invulnerable from everything for a few seconds. Hits will not land and projectiles will simply go through them. However a risk of airdodging is that it makes it impossible to grab a ledge from off the map, so if using an air dodge to recover the player must try to land directly on the stage. After the full airdodge animation is played through then the character will go into a state of helplessness in which they cannot perform any actions whatsoever and will simply fall until they land on a platform, fall till they die, or get hit by an opponent or ally.</p><p>When an airdodge is done into the ground it cancels out the jump animation and has the character land with a small puff of smoke. When a character lands on an angle they will do a small slide against the flat ground of the map.</p><p>A wavedash is when a character does a shorthop with the x or y button (shorthops can be done by using the joystick to jump but they are extremely inefficient and impossible to use for wavedashing) while holding down left or down right. As soon as they do the shorthop while holding the direction they intended they should press L or R to do an airdodge. With everything working together and the airdodge being done while close to the ground and on an angle the character will do a wavedash in either direction.</p><p>Wavedashing is important to learn for all characters however it is a core mechanic for some while it is a bit of an afterthought for others. A character like Peach who has an extremely short wavedash won't generally focus on her wavedash and will most likely use it for positioning her aerial attacks or do dodge attacks. Peach is faster when running. A character like Ice Climbers , however, who have one of the best wavedashes in the game which cover a long distance and can be performed easily use this as their primary form of transport at all times. Especially with Ice Climbers where you want to be fast but want to keep both climbers on the ground in an attempt to grab your opponent so you are open to a chaingrab.</p><p>Wavelanding is an offshoot technique of wavedashing. It is simply using wavedashing when you did not intend to and simply using it when you land from a regular jump. This is used to great effect with characters like Falcon and Falco who have a good enough wavedashes that they can cover most of the platform with just one dash and use it to land. Ganondorf is the character who benefits best from wavelanding on stages like Yoshi's Island and Dreamland 64.</p><p> </p><h3>Black Hole Glitch</h3><p>The Black Hole Glitch is probably the most famous Smash Bros glitch which really has no positive effects. Out of all of the glitches it is probably one of the hardest to do as well because people can follow the steps exactly and sometimes not have it work. It also requires 4 players to do it.</p><p>The setup to do the black hole glitch is to turn items on on high and set the Super Scope on, get two teams in team battle each with their own spacie (Fox or Falco), a Peach on one team and any other character you want as a fourth player. Although the fourth character doesn't matter Ness is usually the most common one as his projectile helps to make playing around with the Black Hole Glitch more fun, but that will be mentioned later.</p><p>The stage should be set to Hyrule Temple. Have the two spacies stand on the very interior edge of the two pillars in the center of the stage which lead to the underground path. Have the other two players go and find a Super Scope from a barrel or a capsule. Once the player obtains the Super Scope have them perform the infinite ammo glitch with the help of the fourth player.</p><p>After you get the infinite ammo have the Peach player stand in the entrance to the tunnel, between and below Fox/Falco. Have the fourth player shoot rapid fire Super Scope shots through his teammate too the enemy across the way. Have the spacie on the opposite platform start to reflect the shots and have the second spacie be ready to immediately reflect them back. Make sure for this that both spacies are holding down their reflectors, it is only necessary for them to hold it on the startup of the glitch.</p><p>As the shots bounce back and forth have the super scope character stop and stagger his shots from time to time in an attempt to get a uniform green line between both reflectors. After a solid beam starts to form between them of the infinite amount of shots being reflected have the Peach underneath start throwing turnips into the beam from below. The Peach should stop around 12 or so, as 15 turnips or more has been known to crash the game.</p><p>At this point the spacies can let go of the reflectors and if everything went alright all of the turnips Peach threw upward should be stuck floating in the center of the two pillars on Hyrule Temple with the circular green glow of the Super Scope shots behind them. It is important to note that the framerate will take a serious dip here and will continue to as you play with this.</p><p>Whichever characters are not on Peaches team can take turns jumping into the black hole. As they jump into it they should get stuck and get rapidly hit until 999% at which point they can wiggle the joystick in an attempt to get thrown out at an angle which is almost guaranteed to kill them.</p><p>At this point however, the damage is being done solely by the turnips so only the people on the opposing team of Peach can get hurt, so this is where having Ness comes in. His PK Fire is a projectile with its own collision hitboxes like Peach's turnips, however a lot of people don't know this because you can't actually collide with them and hit them like the turnips. However this means that if Ness throws a PK Fire into the Black Hole it will get stuck there and the circle will now glow a bright orange. With enough PK Fires added to the Black Hole everyone will be able to play around with it and get hurt and immediately launched to 999% damage.</p><p>It is important to note that even though Ice Climbers neutral b, their icicle projectile has their own collision hitboxes like Peach's turnips and Ness' PK Fire they will not stick into the black hole, as they are intended to break on hit as opposed to the other two.</p><h3>Super Scope Infinite Ammo</h3><p>This glitch is a requirement for doing the Black Hole Glitch. This glitch gives the player infinite ammo for the Super Scope in charge shots or rapid fire shots as long as they don't drop the weapon. At least two characters are needed for this but you only need 1 person to use both controllers.To perform the glitch a player must fire 5 bursts of three rounds a piece and 2 fully charged shots. Next the player should charge up a third shot but get hit while they are charging it. If they are hit while charging their third shot they will get knocked out of it. Pick the gun back up and start shooting it, it should have infinite ammo.</p><p> </p><p>This glitch has no real practical application as it is only really useful when performing the Black Hole Glitch.</p><p> </p><h3>Ice Climbers Freeze Glitch</h3><p>The Ice Climbers Freeze Glitch can be performed in any mode however it is extremely difficult to pull off. This can be done in competitive matches however it is banned as a general rule in every tournament. It also would likely be not very useful to a Ice Climber player due to the difficulty of the trick.</p><p>The actual premise of the trick is simple, all you need to do is desync both Ice Climbers and get Nana to grab the opponent and down throw them while using PoPo's down B on them. If you succeeded at getting the timing right then the opponent should be in midair just above the ground floating and be stuck there. From here you can just keep hitting the opponent and they will only move inches at a time, meaning that they are virtually unkillable while in this glitch. To undo the glitch you need to use PoPo's down B against the frozen enemy to unfreeze them.</p>", "deck": "Super Smash Bros. Melee brings more of everything to the table.

Samus is sent to the planet Aether by the Galactic Federation to look for a missing GF ship and scout team. Upon landing, Samus discovers that Aether is split into two \"halves\" due to a meteor collision: a \"light\" half, which is populated by the friendly, technologically advanced but nigh-extinct Luminoth people; and a \"dark\" half populated by the Ing - a purely destructive race of invaders. These two halves overlap each other, with the regions in the game having both a \"light\" version and a \"dark\" version, the latter usually being a lot more dangerous.</p><p>Critical reception was warm, but not as glowing as it was for its immediate predecessor and successor (<a href=\"/metroid-prime-3-corruption/3030-4725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4725\">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>). Common complaints included the amount of extra backtracking that the \"two dimensions\" concept introduced, as well as a lackluster multiplayer mode. It was praised for its visuals, sound and menu UI, however, and introducing a \"dark world/light world\" mechanic greatly expanded the amount of explorable space, as well as making the game far more challenging for those who sought a tougher Metroid experience.</p><p>There was a mere two year gap between the release of Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, one fourth the time it took Nintendo to make the leap from<i> </i> <a href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid</a> to the aforementioned. Although Nintendo spent only three years on Metroid Prime and weren't cooking the game for the full eight years they were neglecting the franchise, the difference in numbers led a small number of less observant Metroid fans to speculate as to whether Retro could repeat the same success in such a short time. Metroid Prime 2 was received well critically, but was lost amongst the Q4 '04 rush of <a href=\"/half-life-2/3030-1539/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-Life 2</a>, <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/3030-18082/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, and <a href=\"/halo-2/3030-7110/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2</a>.</p><p>In the style of Halo 2's I Love Bees alternate reality game, Metroid Prime 2 also had an online viral marketing campaign. The campaign consisted of two websites: Orbis Labs and Channel 51. Orbis Labs was apparently a weapons development company that was, at the time, working on a piece of machinery known as the Battle Sphere, a nod to the Morph Ball featured in the Metroid series. Channel 51 was a blog in the style of a typical conspiracy theory website. Run by a \"<b>Sam</b>antha Man<b>us</b>,\" Channel 51 featured distorted Metroid Prime 2 footage as supposed video evidence of alien visitation to Earth, as well as other hints alluding to a few gameplay elements. When Metroid Prime 2 actually came out, \"Manus\" posted one last blog message bitterly complaining that she had been tricked and that \"it was all for a video game\", leading some less intelligent fans to wonder whether Channel 51 was a real conspiracy theory website that had been deliberately mislead by Nintendo to advertise their product.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Metroid Prime 2, taking place six months after the events of Metroid Prime, (which itself took place in the years in between the original <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\"> Metroid</a> and the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\"> Game Boy</a> sequel <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\"> Metroid II: Return of Samus</a>) revolves around the conflict between two races, the <a href=\"/luminoth/3015-1552/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1552\"> Luminoth</a> and the <a href=\"/ing/3015-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1459\"> Ing</a>, on the planet <a href=\"/aether/3035-378/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-378\"> Aether</a>. Centuries prior to Samus' arrival, Aether was hit by a meteor of <a href=\"/phazon/3015-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\"> Phazon</a>, duplicating the planet in a <a href=\"/dark-aether/3035-501/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-501\"> Dark realm</a>, thus splitting the planet into two parallel universes. The Dark version of Aether became home to the Ing, a race of malevolent creatures of pure darkness, able to possess both organisms and machines. The Space Pirates, upon recently discovering Aether, had decided to harvest the Phazon in order to make up for their defeat on <a href=\"/tallon-iv/3035-168/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\"> Tallon IV</a>. Samus Aran is sent to investigate, where she learns that the Luminoth, the original dwellers of the \"light\" Aether, had all but lost an ongoing battle between them and the Ing. It is Samus's mission to restore peace to Aether by defeating the Ing while simultaneously ridding the planet of Space Pirates and the mysterious <a href=\"/dark-samus/3005-3663/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3663\"> Dark Samus</a>, a hostile duplicate of Samus who clearly has some connection to the Phazon corrupting the planet.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Metroid Prime 2 carried most of its mechanics over from Metroid Prime, with a few minor improvements. For one, scanning was greatly improved, by removing the scan targets, instead allowing Samus to scan anywhere on an object/enemy. In addition, objects and items are now color-coordinated. Important scans are now in red, and less important scans are now in blue. Objects Samus have already scanned are now in green. These refinements make scanning much easier in comparison, and was there once again in the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\"> Nintendo Wii</a> sequel Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</p><p>Another additional is the controversial use of ammo for energy beams; although the standard Power Beam has unlimited energy, as always, the new Dark Beam and Light Beam have a limited supply of ammo. Killing enemies with the Dark Beam nets Samus light ammo, and vice-versa, in addition to being able to replenish her supplies with crates and ammo stations. Using the Light Beam on \"dark\" enemies or the Ing kills them faster than Samus's normal Power Beam, and the Dark Beam kills regular enemies faster. Finally, the \"Annihilator Beam\", which is extra-effective on all enemy types, uses both Dark and Light ammo to fire. Charging shots for all three weapons creates more powerful attacks, but drains more ammo than normal. Because some doors must be opened with different beams, just as in previous Metroid titles, even if a beam has zero ammo left, the player can \"charge up\" the empty weapon to fire a single regular-powered shot.</p><p>The final aspect of Metroid Prime 2 that differs from Metroid Prime is the Nintendo tradition of light and dark worlds. While normal Aether will not harm Samus in any way, the corrosive atmosphere of Dark Aether will constantly drain her health until she dies, although pools of light scattered about by the Luminoth during their failed invasions of Dark Aether will protect and even heal Samus; indeed, because these pools of light will actually heal her health fully instead of just replenishing damage suffered by the corrosive atmosphere, Dark Aether is actually safer for Samus since she can always retreat to the safety of a light pool and wait to become 100% healed. Eventually, Samus locates the Dark Suit upgrade, which greatly increases her resistance to Dark Aether's atmosphere, slowing down the rate at which it burns away her health, and later on the Light Suit, which renders her completely impervious to the dark atmosphere, though pools of light will still heal her.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>In Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Samus earns a wide variety of weapons and power-ups throughout the game to aid her on her adventure. Although she starts out with some of them, they are <a href=\"/abilitease/3015-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-57\">taken away early on</a>.</p><h3>Power Beam</h3><p>The default weapon, which allows Samus to fire the fastest. She can also Hold the fire button to charge it, otherwise known as the Charge Beam.</p><h3><b>Light Beam</b></h3><p>The light beam can go through multiple enemies, and it has the possibility to set enemies on fire. This uses light energy ammo. Charging it allows Samus to fire a Lightblast attack, which costs 5 Light ammo to use.</p><h3>Dark Beam</h3><p>The dark beam fires shadow energy, which has the possibility to slow down enemies and objects. This uses dark energy ammo. Charging it allows Samus to fire an Entangler attack, which costs 5 Dark ammo to use.</p><h3><b>Annihilator Beam</b></h3><p>This beam combines the power of the Light and Dark beams, and uses both light and dark energy to use. Charging it allows Samus to fire a Disruptor attack, which costs 5 of each type of energy ammo to use.</p><h3>Sunburst</h3><p>The Sunburst is the Charge Combo for the Light Beam, a slow moving, widespread attack which will set enemies on fire. Using it requires 5 missiles as well as 30 Light ammo.</p><h3>Darkburst</h3><p>The Darkburst is the Charge Combo for the Dark Beam, which opens up a portal to a dark dimension, pulling enemies into it. Using it requires 5 missiles as well as 30 Dark ammo.</p><h3>Sonic Boom</h3><p>The Sonic Boom is the Annihilator Charge Combo. Using it costs 5 missiles, 30 light ammo and 30 dark ammo.</p><h3>Missile Launcher</h3><p>This allows Samus to fire Missiles, and she can either fire them with or without a lock-on. They can also destroy objects made of Brinstone.</p><h3>Seeker Missile Launcher</h3><p>This weapon upgrade allows Samus to fire missiles at multiple targets at the same time by allowing her to charge her missiles. However, the Seeker Missiles cannot be engaged without wasting a single missile first in order to start the system. Samus can also lock onto the same enemy multiple times.</p><h3>Super Missile</h3><p>By charging the Power Beam then using a Missile allows Samus to fire a Super Missile. Using the Super Missile costs 5 missiles.</p><h3>Morph Ball Bomb</h3><p>This is the default weapon while in the Morph Ball form. It can also be used to break cracked walls as well as perform a power ball jump. It can also break items made of Talloric alloy.</p><h3>Power Bomb</h3><p>This is the strongest Morph Ball weapon. It can destroy a lot of materials, including Denzium, and each expansion Samus finds for it will increase its capacity by one.</p><h2>Suit Expansions</h2><p>Suit Expansions are nothing new to the Metroid franchise, but in this game they brought some more familiar expansions into the 3D realm as well as some new ones.</p><h3>Morph Ball</h3><p>The Morph Ball allows Samus to travel through tight corridors and travel faster overall, and is upgradeable.</p><h3>Boost Ball</h3><p>This upgrade allows Samus to quickly speed through areas, and she can also charge it up. By charging up the boost ball in some devices, it can solve some puzzles as well as get past some obstacles. Samus can also damage some enemies by boosting into them.</p><h3>Spider Ball</h3><p>This allows Samus to move across magnetic rails. By combining this with the Boost Ball she can propel to other Magnetic rails, a feature not present in the original Metroid Prime.</p><h3>Space Jump Boots</h3><p>These allow Samus to jump higher as well as perform a <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\"> double jump</a>.</p><h3>Gravity Boost</h3><p>This allows Samus to move through water without limitations, so in essence, it's the <a href=\"/gravity-suit/3055-1033/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\"> Gravity Suit</a>, but not in suit form. By combining it with the Space Jump Boots in water, by holding B she can slowly rise and move through water.</p><h3>Grapple Beam</h3><p>This allows Samus to swing back and forth using grapple points found in the game. She can also change her direction while swinging.</p><h3>Screw Attack</h3><p>This allows Samus to turn into a moving weapon while jumping. She has a limited amount of jumps, but she can also slightly steer where she is going as well. Samus can also perform a wall jump while facing a special wall surface and bouncing off it in midair.</p><h3>Varia Suit</h3><p>This is the default suit, and while on <a href=\"/dark-aether/3035-501/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-501\"> Dark Aether</a>, Samus's energy is drained rapidly by its atmosphere.</p><h3>Dark Suit</h3><p>This suit decreases the amount of energy Samus loses while on Dark Aether through its atmosphere.</p><h3>Light Suit</h3><p>This suit negates all damage Samus takes from Dark Aether's atmosphere and she won't be impeded by its toxic water. This suit also allows her to transfer quickly through Aether's regions using <a href=\"/fast-travel/3015-676/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-676\"> teleportation</a>.</p><h3>Combat Visor</h3><p>This is the default visor, which allows the player to view Samus's ammo meter, the amount of missiles she has, as well as her health meter.</p><h3>Scan Visor</h3><p>This visor is used to collect data on anything, enemies included. Some devices will also activate when Samus scans them. All scans will be recorded in the logbook, and keep in mind that there are different colors of scans for the most important things.</p><h3>Dark Visor</h3><p>This visor allows Samus to see invisible objects and enemies as well as highlight enemies as a targeting aid.</p><h3>Echoes Visor</h3><p>This visor uses sound to detect invisible enemies and objects, but is mostly used to interact with sonic-based security systems.</p><h2>Trilogy Re-Release</h2><p>On August 24th, 2009, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes was re-released as part of the <a href=\"/metroid-prime-trilogy/3030-26559/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26559\"> Metroid Prime Trilogy</a> collection on the Nintendo Wii.

By accomplishing missions or reaching specific points, the player earns <a href=\"/skill-points/3015-2220/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2220\">skill points</a> which may then be used to unlock and develop new skills and techniques. The points can be placed into three <a href=\"/skill-tree/3015-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-382\">categories</a>:</p><ul><li><b>Combat</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Magic</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Miscellaneous</b></li></ul><p>This allows the player to specialize their character to their personal needs. There is no way to max out all skill trees in a playthrough, even by completing optional mission objectives, so specialization is encouraged.</p><p>The game has up to four multiple endings, though all choices appear only in the last two levels. The first choice relies on completing an optional objective to purge yourself of your demonic abilities, and the second is immediately after the final boss on whether to join or destroy the soon-to-be-awakened lord of darkness.</p><p>Dark Messiah also has an <a href=\"/inventory/3015-513/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-513\">inventory system</a>.

After the bullet fragments are removed and your wound is cleaned and healed, Mitchell asks you your name; after you tell him, he holds a mirror in front of you and asks if he \"left anything out of place,\" and this is where you create and customize the look of your character.</p><p>Soon after, Mitchell shows you to the Vit-O-Matic Vigor-Tester. After that he then asks you some word association questions. Once those are answered he shows you some Rorschach images and asks you to tell him the first thing that comes to your mind. After all of his tests are finished, he gives the player a couple items and a <a href=\"/pip-boy/3055-386/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-386\">Pip-Boy</a> 3000 and sets you on your way. Your objective in the game is centered around finding out the identity of the assailant and why the package you were carrying was so important. Siding with either one of the two major factions, <a href=\"/caesars-legion/3015-4828/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4828\">Caesar's Legion</a> and the <a href=\"/new-california-republic/3015-4845/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4845\">New California Republic</a>, and settling their constant conflicts plays a crucial role in the story of Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Sometime in early 2009 <a href=\"/obsidian-entertainment/3010-1520/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1520\">Obsidian Entertainment</a> was approached by <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda Softworks</a> to develop a title in the <a href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-183\">Fallout franchise</a> for them. The Obsidian higher-ups quickly agreed with Bethesda and work on the game was started shortly thereafter. During the Bethesda Softworks London event on April 20, 2009, the company announced the development of a new video game entry in the Fallout franchise, in development at Obsidian Entertainment.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396734\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396734\"><img alt=\"The men and women that are taking you to New Vegas\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1396734-newvegasteam.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The men and women that are taking you to New Vegas</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2003 when the original creator of <a href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-183\">Fallout</a>, <a href=\"/black-isle-studios/3010-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-99\">Black Isle Studios</a>, was shut down by <a href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\">Interplay Entertainment</a> due to financial troubles, <a href=\"/feargus-urquhart/3040-11015/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-11015\">Feargus Urquhart</a>, the founder of Black Isle Studios, went on to create Obsidian Entertainment that same year with <a href=\"/chris-avellone/3040-12929/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12929\">Chris Avellone</a>, <a href=\"/chris-jones/3040-866/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-866\">Chris Jones</a>, <a href=\"/chris-parker/3040-12778/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12778\">Chris Parker</a>, and <a href=\"/darren-l-monahan/3040-10989/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-10989\">Darren Monahan</a>.</p><p>Fallout: New Vegas is being developed by many of the people that created the first and second Fallout games. For example, <a href=\"/je-sawyer/3040-25518/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-25518\">Josh Sawyer</a> is the lead designer and project directer of Fallout: New Vegas. He was previously the lead designer of \" <a href=\"/van-buren/3030-32966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32966\">Van Buren</a>\", the canceled first attempt to create a third Fallout game, and besides location, some story elements are also being used from <a href=\"/van-buren/3030-32966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32966\">Van Buren</a>.</p><p>Fallout: New Vegas is known by many employees at Obsidian as Van Buren's <a href=\"/spiritual-successor/3015-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-425\">spiritual successor</a>. New Vegas features many locations that were set to appear in Van Buren, such as the <a href=\"/hoover-dam/3035-3072/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3072\">Hoover Dam</a>.</p><p>Fallout: New Vegas will be using the <a href=\"/gamebryo-25/3015-2021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2021\">Gamebryo</a> engine, the same engine that was featured in <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a>. The G.E.C.K. editing software, which is based off the Gamebryo engine, will be used to create Fallout: New Vegas. New Vegas will also be re-using many assets from Fallout 3, such as models and textures. Fallout: New Vegas was released on October 19, 2010 in North America and October 22, 2010 in Europe, for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and the PC.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294331\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294331\"><img alt=\"V.A.T.S. returns.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"V.A.T.S. returns.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1294331-ieklnt.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>V.A.T.S. returns.</figcaption></figure><p>Fallout: New Vegas plays identically to <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a> with some added improvements, including the following: customizable weapon attachments, such as extended clips and sights (all of which are reflected by the in game weapon model), specialty ammo, special attacks in VATS mode for all weapons (for example the \"fore\" attack with the 9 iron, which is an upward swing at the target) and more dialogue options based on the players stats: explosives, bartering etc. A good example of this is when you're in Goodsprings you can use your explosives skill to convince <a href=\"/easy-pete/3005-14288/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14288\">Easy Pete</a> to relinquish his dynamite stash to you. You can now aim using iron sights instead of just zooming the camera in. The third person view has been improved and the developer acknowledges that people wanted to play it as more of a shooter instead of relying on V.A.T.S. so the shooting mechanics have been improved to accommodate for this. In Fallout 3, the level cap was level 20, then raised to 30 once the Broken Steel downloadable content was released. In Fallout: New Vegas the level cap is 30 right from the start and expands to a maximum of 50 with the DLCs. Perks are now earned every 2 levels instead of every level in Fallout 3 and every third level in <a href=\"/fallout-2/3030-5559/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5559\">Fallout 2</a>.</p><p>The character customization options are virtually the same as Fallout 3's. After Doc Mitchell brings you back from the desert and fixes you up he will ask you your name and then give you the Reflection. The Reflection is a mirror that will allow you to choose your race, facial options, and your age. After your character is to your liking Mitchell will escort you to the Vit-O-Matic Vigor-Tester, which will allow you to assign your S.P.E.C.I.A.L character points. The game also introduces the companion wheel where you can give various commands to each of your companions such as how far they should be following you and their combat tactics. You can also tell them to use a <a href=\"/stimpak/3055-1133/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1133\">stimpak</a> if needed.</p><p>Fallout 3 protected the lives of story-related characters by having them fall unconscious instead of dying. Obsidian has completely gotten rid of this (Note: there is only one adult of the 2200 NPCs in the game that cannot be killed though children are still unkillable). Now players can complete the game by killing all the NPCs featured in the game, or they can play the entire game as a pacifist. Bean bag ammunition for your guns and boxing gloves have a \"Fatigue\" effect which will knock out a NPC rather then killing them, allowing the player to be a pacifist.</p><h3>Karma &amp; Reputation</h3><p>The <a href=\"/reputation/3015-2741/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2741\">karma</a> system returns once again, but this time it isn't the primary way other characters perceive you. The primary purpose of the karma system is to show how moral or immoral you are based on your total actions throughout the game. Having karmic extremes still carries consequence, though, as certain followers will refuse to join the Courier if they dislike the player's karmic alignment. In addition to the karma system, Fallout: New Vegas is re-introducing the reputation system featured in the original Fallout games. Raising your reputation in individual towns, settlements, and factions will give you special privileges with that town/settlement/faction. There's also a reputation meter that shows you how well liked or hated you are. Based on your actions there are several reputations in the game.</p><h3>Health &amp; Item Degradation</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1362230\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1362230\"><img alt=\"Killing an enemy with a melee weapon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Killing an enemy with a melee weapon\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30036/1362230-fore2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Killing an enemy with a melee weapon</figcaption></figure><p>Like in Fallout 3, characters' limbs can become crippled after receiving too much damage. Each limb will have a different effect when it's crippled. For example, a crippled leg will cause the character to move slowly while a crippled arm will decrease accuracy dramatically. Crippled limbs can be repaired using Stimpaks or a new item called a Doctor's Bag, which automatically heals all crippled limbs. In Hardcore mode, Stimpaks cannot be used for this purpose. Instead, players must find a doctor or use a Doctor's Bag. Unlike Fallout 3, consumable items like food and beverages heal over time instead of automatically. The same chems from Fallout 3 are in Fallout: New Vegas including some new ones. They are all just as addictive.</p><p>Item degradation returns as well. Equipment including clothing/armor and weapons will wear out over time and become less effective. Items can be repaired using parts from another item of the same type or by paying someone who is capable of fixing items (this generally costs a lot of caps depending on the item and the amount of wear the item has).</p><p>Finally, radiation is once again something that can affect the player if they aren't careful. Some places have life-threatening amounts of radiation such as <a href=\"/camp-searchlight/3035-3698/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3698\">Camp Searchlight</a>, a town that is practically drowning in it.</p><h3>Minigames</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1109867\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1109867\"><img alt=\"Lockpicking is the same as it was in Fallout 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lockpicking is the same as it was in Fallout 3\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1109867-falloutlockpick.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lockpicking is the same as it was in Fallout 3</figcaption></figure><p>Lockpicking and computer hacking are frequent occurrences in Fallout: New Vegas, and a minigame is present for each. Lockpicking is done with a screw driver (something that the player has with them at all times) and bobby pins. The player must rotate the bobby pin to a certain position in the lock and apply torque with the screw driver. Too much torque in the wrong area will cause the bobby pin to snap. The Lockpick skill dictates the difficulty level of locks that the player can attempt to pick.</p><p>Hacking computers is a longer and more challenging process. The screen comes up with a list of jumbled characters containing possible passwords. By guessing a password, the player is shown how many letters of the guessed word are in their correct positions in the password the terminal is actually looking for. This allows the player to narrow down future choices. If the player uses up their limited supply of guesses, they are locked out of the computer. The Science skill dictates what computers the player can hack.</p><h2>Factions</h2><p>There are several major factions in the game that have an important impact on the plot, the player will have an option to either, side with, attack or remain neutral with any given faction.</p><h3>Major Factions</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/new-california-republic/3015-4845/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4845\"><b>NCR</b></a> - The New California Republic, is possibly the last form of an organized government.

These include: scopes for longer range and more precise shots, extended magazines for a expanded ammo pool, silencers for a more stealth based character, and faster reloading for lever action rifles. You can even find mods for Melee weapons, such as a cork core for the baseball bat, increasing damage. Weapons can only have a max of three weapon modifications at a time.</p><p>Specialized ammunition appears in Fallout: New Vegas, such as hollow point, armor piercing and <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> Military grade ammunition. There are also ammunition variations that do a great deal more damage than standard ammunition, but the downside to having this type of ammo means your weapons' quality degrades faster and requires you to repair it more often. These types of ammunition appear more commonly in explosive and energy based weapons.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p>In a recent <a href=\"http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1098302-fallout-new-vegas-fan-interview/\" rel=\"nofollow\">interview</a> a developer confirmed that traits would be making a return appearance from Fallout 1 and 2 into Fallout New Vegas. Traits are like perks, but are chosen during character creation and usually don't allow modifications or additional traits throughout the game. Players can choose up to 2 traits, or none at all. Traits mainly focus on making each character appear distinctly different as well as play differently right after character creation by having each trait contain a bonus to one specific playstyle, while detracting from another such as:</p><ul><li><b>Built to Destroy</b> - 3% chance to critical hit with all weapons, but their condition decays 15% faster.</li><li><b>Claustrophobia</b> (Old World Blues) - +1 to SPECIAL attributes while outdoors, but -1 when indoors.</li><li><b>Early Bird</b> (Old World Blues) - +2 to SPECIAL attributes from 6am to 12 pm, -1 from 6pm to 6am.</li><li><b>Fast Shot</b> - You fire 20% faster when using guns and energy weapons, but shots are 20% less accurate.</li><li><b>Four Eyes</b> - Bonus to Perception while wearing glasses, but negatively impacts perception when not wearing them.</li><li><b>Good Natured</b> - Bonus to Speech and Barter skills, but decreases ability with weapons.</li><li><b>Heavy Handed</b> - Melee and unarmed attacks do more damage, but damage from critical hits is reduced.</li><li><b>Hoarder</b> (Old World Blues) - The player gains +25 lbs. to total carry weight, but suffers a -1 to all SPECIAL attributes when the weight of carried equipment is less than 160 lbs.</li><li><b>Hot Blooded</b> (Old World Blues) - When the character has less than 50% health he gains a +15% increase in damage, but he/she also receives a -2 to Agility and Perception.</li><li><b>Kamikaze</b> - Bonus 10 Action Points, but -2 to Damage Threshold.</li><li><b>Logan's Loophole</b> (Old World Blues) - Chems last twice as long, no chance of addiction. Level cap of 30.</li><li><b>Loose Cannon</b> - Thrown weapons are 30% faster, but have 25% less range.</li><li>Skilled (Old World Blues) - +5 to all skills, -10% experience gain.</li><li><b>Small Frame</b> - Bonus to Agility, but limbs break more easily.</li><li><b>Trigger Discipline</b> - Guns and energy weapons are 20% more accurate, but are 20% slower.</li><li><b>Wild Wasteland</b> - Adds humorous random encounters to the game.</li></ul><h3>Interactions</h3><p>Throughout the game you will meet people who will join your team. Unlike in Fallout 3 you no longer have to go through a <a href=\"/\">dialogue tree</a> in order to do simple things such as sort through inventory or administer a stimpak. Instead when you select a companion a radial wheel will appear in order to make selections easy. The radial wheel is very similar to the one seen in the <a href=\"/mass-effect/3025-560/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-560\">Mass Effect</a> series.</p><p>The gameplay of companions is very different in Fallout: New Vegas, mostly because of the revamped AI for NPC's in general. Not only are companions smarter in combat but they also have opinions and quest lines. Depending on how you interact with your companions you will get various results. These results will range from entire quest lines to just making him/her or it angry or various other emotions depending on what you make them equip or do. You are allowed one humanoid, and one non-humanoid in your party at one time.</p><h3>Hardcore Mode</h3><p>One of the new features in Fallout: New Vegas is Hardcore Mode. The new feature is first offered right before the courier leaves Doc Mitchell's house. If the player turns on Hardcore mode and plays through with the feature on all the way to the end of the game, the player will receive an achievement/trophy at the end of the game. The mode can be toggled on and off at any time in-game. In Hardcore Mode the player can suffer from dehydration,starvation, and sleep deprivation which requires players to keep those cycles in check or the courier can be suffered with deadly side effects and eventually death. Ammo has weight, and Stimpaks and Radaway heal over time as opposed to healing instantly in normal mode. Also, the only way to treat crippled limbs in Hardcore Mode is to visit a doctor, use doctor bags, or use the addictive chem of Hydra. Another note worth thing is that sleeping does not have the same effect in Hardcore mode compared to the normal version of the game. Unless the courier is sleeping in an owned bed, the courier can not heal themselves or their limps by sleeping. Lastly, any companions that the courier acquires can permanently die off.</p><h3>Weapon Mods</h3><p>This section details every weapon mod in Fallout: New Vegas (not including DLC weapons).

Casinos feature all sorts of gambling mini-games, such as, blackjack, poker, roulette, and slot machines. Each casino keeps track of the players winnings in each game if the player wins enough in a certain mini-game, for example: blackjack, they will be allowed to start betting at the high roller table. If the player makes an enormous amount of money, they will bust the casino and be forced to leave, three of the major casinos on the strip have a winnings limit of 10.000 caps. If the player busts all of the casinos in the game they will be awarded with an achievement or trophy.</p><ul><li><h3><b><a href=\"/the-strip/3035-3575/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3575\">The Strip</a></b></h3></li></ul><p>Contains most of the Casinos in the game. Each casino is almost a mini faction if not part of a bigger faction in the game. You can gamble in each and the rules and style is different for each one. Most if not all of the casinos accept each of the games two new currencies and bottle caps. The two new currencies are NCR dollars and Caesar's Coins. The player is allowed to win a maximum of 9,000 chips in the Gomorrah, 10,000 in The Tops and 15,000 in the Ultra-Luxe. Once the player reaches the respective limits, they forced to stop gambling at the casino.</p><ul><li><h3><a href=\"/lucky-38/3035-3383/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3383\"><b>Lucky 38</b></a></h3></li></ul><p>The Lucky 38 is the home of the mysterious Mr. House. Nobody has been seen entering the Lucky 38 in quite some time. The Lucky 38 towers over everything else on the strip; it can be seen from nearly everywhere in the Mojave Wasteland.</p><ul><li><h3><a href=\"/vault-21/3035-3415/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3415\"><b>Vault 21</b></a></h3></li></ul><p>This Vault was designed with a Vegas flavor as the rules were designed with gambling in mind. Every dispute was determined by bets until Mr. House bet them for the vault and won. Vault 21 is located underneath New Vegas. It is still populated with it's original inhabitants but has since been opened to the outside world. Vault 21 is now a hotel and a gambling hot spot in New Vegas.</p><ul><li><h3><a href=\"/the-ultra-luxe/3035-3419/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3419\"><b>The Ultra-Luxe</b></a></h3></li></ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894762\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894762\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129918/1894762-2011_09_03_00002.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>This is the fancy place that everyone wants to go to enjoy finest dining in the Mojave wasteland. It is fancy and you'll most likely find very good health boosting food here. The casino is one of the most pristine buildings in the in-game world.</p><ul><li><h3><a href=\"/the-tops/3035-3574/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3574\">The Tops</a></h3></li></ul><p>The most secured casino in all of New Vegas. The Tops is known for its Frank Sinatra music, slot machines, roulette wheel, and blackjack tables. The casino has the most security personnel of any casino in New Vegas, having guards posted everywhere you look. Weapons are strictly forbidden inside the tops. When attempting to enter the tops you will have to relinquish your weapons to the security guards outside.</p><ul><li><h3>Vikki and Vance</h3></li></ul><p>Located in Primm, the casino is named after the notorious bandit duo Vikki and Vance (an homage to Bonny and Clyde) the player needs to eliminate the Powder Gangers and reestablish law within the town for the casino to open up again. It's one of the few things that attract people towards the town of Primm. The winning limit is 2700 caps.</p><ul><li><h3>The Atomic Wrangler</h3></li></ul><p>A casino that is situated in Freeside. This casino is by no means luxurious,but if you cant get into Vegas, this is the place to be. The casino is run by the Garret twins (James and Francine) they can usually be seen at the reception. The winning limit is 5.000 caps.</p><ul><li>Sierra Madre Casino</li></ul><p>The Sierra Madre Casino can be found in the Dead Money addon, the casino is surrounded by rumors of great pre-war treasure which many have tried to steal but none have succeeded. Unlike any other casinos in the Mojave Wasteland this one only uses Sierra Madre chips, which the player can use to gamble or buy items from Sierra Madre vending machines. Once the player wins 7500 chips he gets a complementary voucher which he can use at the vending machines to get a 1000 free chips. The winning limit is 10.000 and unlike other casinos slots in this one have only a 25 maximum bet instead of 200 this means that the player can't exceed the winning limit, at least not to 32.000 chips. Once the player leaves Sierra Madre he can still get complementary vouchers (provided he won one in the casino) he can use the vouchers at the Sierra Madre vending machine in the Abandoned BoS Bunker to get the 1000 free chips and then buy items from the list, provided he found their codes while in Sierra Madre.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p>On August 18, 2010, Senior Producer <a href=\"/jason-bergman/3040-77484/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-77484\">Jason Bergman</a> told gaming website, Destructoid in an interview, that downloadable content is already being planned.

He did so when he learned that the Courier's name was on the list of the six couriers. In the transmission that the Courier receives, Ulysses promises to answer why, only if the Courier took one last job to the Divide. An area that has been ruined by frequent earthquakes and storms. There begins the fabled location of the battle between Ulysses and the Courier. This DLC will raise the level cap by 5, bringing to maximum level to 50.</p><h3>Courier's Stash</h3><p>Will include all preorder bonus packs. This includes the Caravan Pack, Classic Pack, Mercenary Pack, and Tribal Pack.</p><h3>Gun Runner's Arsenal</h3><p>Gun Runner's Arsenal adds more unique weapons, weapon mods, ammo types, and recipes to the vendors of the Mojave Wasteland. Many of these weapons have high prices, high stats, and are acquirable at any point in the game.</p><h2>Bug Reports</h2><p>Fallout: New Vegas was the center of attention on forum outlets for weeks due to launching with hundreds of game-breaking bugs and glitches which have been reported by players all over the world.

In a mid-game <a href=\"/plot-twist/3015-442/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-442\">plot twist</a>, players also witness the resurrection of System Shock's primary <a href=\"/antagonist/3015-1070/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1070\">antagonist</a>, the malevolent <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">artificial intelligence</a> known as <a href=\"/shodan/3005-423/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-423\">SHODAN</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game begins in 2114, forty-two years after the original System Shock. After the protagonist, Soldier G65434-2, joins the United National Nominate, he is assigned to the Rickenbacker, a military spacecraft. This ship is appointed to escort the maiden-voyage of the Von Braun, an experimental starship capable of faster-than-light space travel.</p><p>A couple of months into the journey, the ships respond to a distress signal originating from the planet Tau Ceti V. A rescue team is deployed to the surface of the planet, where they discover strange eggs throughout the entire facility and nearby area. The eggs suddenly infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion that calls itself <a href=\"/the-many/3005-14271/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14271\">The Many</a>. Upon the rescue team's return, the infestation takes over both ships.</p><p>Soldier G65434-2 awakens in a cryo-tube in the medical wing of the Von Braun with amnesia due to a computer malfunction. He is immediately contacted by another survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides the soldier to safety seconds before the medical wing depressurizes. Dr Polito implores the soldier to meet with her on Deck 4. As he makes his way to his objective, the soldier battles the infected crew members; all the while, The Many communicates telepathically with the soldier, inciting him to join their collective.</p><p>After the soldier restarts the Rickenbacker's engine core, incinerating everything in the elevator shaft, he reaches Deck 4 and discovers that Dr. Polito has been dead for some time. He is confronted by SHODAN, the rogue artificial intelligence that caused the devastation on Citadel Station in the previous game. She reveals that she has been posing as Dr. Polito to gain his trust, and is solely responsible for creating The Many. They are the results of bio-engineering experiments on the denizens of Citadel Station. Forty-two years earlier, an unnamed <a href=\"/the-nameless-hacker/3005-21096/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21096\">hacker</a> ejected the grove that contained both SHODAN and her experiments into space to prevent them from contaminating Earth. When the grove landed on Tau Ceti V, SHODAN was forced into hibernation. This allowed The Many to grow beyond her control. SHODAN subsequently issues an ultimatum: The soldier must help her destroy her creations, or die.</p><p>Soldier G65434-2 tries to regain control of the main computers, but ultimately fails. SHODAN informs him that destroying the Von Braun is their only option, but he must first transfer SHODAN's consciousness to the Rickenbacker. While en route, the soldier briefly finds two survivors, Tommy Suarez and Rebecca Siddons, who flee the ship on a working escape pod.</p><p>When the transfer is complete, the soldier travels to the Rickenbacker and learns that both ships have been infected by The Many's source: a giant mass of organic tissue. The soldier enters its mass and destroys the core from within, stopping the spread of the infection. SHODAN congratulates the protagonist and informs him of its original intentions: to merge physical reality with cyberspace by subverting the reality-altering mechanics of the Von Braun ship. The soldier subsequently confronts SHODAN in <a href=\"/cyberspace/3035-242/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-242\">CyberSpace</a> and defeats her.</p><p>The final scene of the game shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the Von Braun. Tommy answers, telling the soldier that they will return for him but Rebecca isn't feeling well. She is heard speaking in the same voice as SHODAN.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p><b>Soldier G65434-2:</b> The player character, and the main protagonist of System Shock 2. Depending on which branch of the military the players decides to choose, they will either be in the Navy, Marines, or Psi-Ops.</p><p><b>SHODAN:</b> SHODAN makes a terrifying return as the main antagonist in System Shock 2. Unsatisfied with how her \"God experiment\" went in the creation of The Many, she manipulates the protagonist to clean up her mess.</p><p><b>XERXES:</b> XERXES is the AI aboard the Von Braun. XERXES gets co-opted by the Bio-mass of the Many and helps them run riot on the Von Braun. Later on in the game, SHODAN assimilates his AI core.</p><p><b>Dr. Marie Delacroix:</b> One of the only people left alive on board the Von Braun. She is the main liaison between the protagonist and the corrupted environments and creatures of the crippled Von Braun and Rickenbacker.</p><p><b>Dr. Janice Polito:</b> SHODAN mimics her voice over the radio transmissions to the protagonist in order to establish trust. Once this has been established, the protagonist discovers Dr. Polito's body on the Ops deck and finds out that she has been dead for quite sometime and that he was following SHODAN's orders all along.</p><p><b>Capt. William Bedford Diego:</b> Captain Diego is the son of Edward Diego, the vice-president of TriOptimum Corp from the first System Shock. He is the Captain of the UNN Rickenbacker, the military battle-cruiser escort for the Von Braun.</p><h2>Reception and Legacy</h2><p>System Shock 2 was noted for the original aspects of its design, including the usage of crew member <a href=\"/audio-logs/3015-2038/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2038\">audio logs</a> as a narrative device. These voice recordings tell the story of what happened aboard the Von Braun and, in some cases, document the horrific transformation of the crew into mindless, savage agents of The Many. This method of storytelling allowed the story to flow at the pace of the player's progress, instead of sweeping the player along by force. The game is also noted for its <a href=\"/atmosphere/3015-436/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-436\">atmosphere</a> and tension, and to this day it ranks on many critics' lists as one of the scariest games ever produced.</p><p>Despite the game's critical acclaim, piracy and a lack of marketing resulted in lackluster sales, and System Shock 2 is known today more as a cult hit than a commercial success.</p><p>Although it wasn't a huge commercial hit, a lot of game mechanics and ideas were refined and used many years later in System Shock 2's critically and commercially acclaimed spiritual successor, <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">Bioshock</a>, including the use of audio logs, <a href=\"/plasmid/3055-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-24\">plasmids</a> in place of <a href=\"/cybernetics/3015-2944/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2944\">cybernetic</a> upgrades, and a similar mid-game <a href=\"/plot-twist/3015-442/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-442\">plot twist</a>. <a href=\"/deus-ex/3030-17533/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17533\">Deus Ex</a>, another well received game whose development was lead by <a href=\"/system-shock/3025-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-313\">System Shock franchise</a> creator <a href=\"/warren-spector/3040-2978/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2978\">Warren Spector</a>, also used many of the ideas of it's predecessor, most notably cybernetic augmentations and the integration of RPG elements with FPS gameplay.</p><p><a href=\"/glados/3005-722/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-722\">GLaDOS</a> , the main villain of <a href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\">Portal</a> is often considered to be an homage to <a href=\"/shodan/3005-423/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-423\">SHODAN</a>, as both are malevolent female AIs who goad and taunt the player as they progress throughout the game.</p><h2>Modding</h2><p>Although many years have passed since its release, System Shock 2 still has many devoted fans and modding community. The most known mods are Rebirth, which replaces some of the game's original <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC</a> 3D assets with new, fan made, high-resolution models, and SHTUP, which updates the original textures of the game with newer high-res versions. The ability to utilize these complex, high resolution assets is a testament to the versatility of the Dark Engine, which SS2 and the original <a href=\"/thief-deadly-shadows/3030-2335/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2335\">Thief</a> were built on. The community is also responsible for high number of fixes and tweaks, which help to run SS2 on newer operating systems and video cards. The main \"base of operations\" for the community is <a href=\"/looking-glass-studios-inc/3010-2858/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2858\">Looking Glass Studios</a>' forum, even though the company itself ceased to exist on the 24th of may, 2000.</p><h2>Re-Release through Digital Distribution</h2><p>On February 13th 2013, it was announced that the System Shock rights and trademark (notoriously caught in a complicated legal triangle for many years) had finally been secured by Stephen Kick of <a href=\"/night-dive-studios/3010-9691/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9691\">Night Dive Studios</a> who approached <a href=\"/gogcom/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG</a> with an aim to releasing the title on the popular digital distribution service, with a later <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam </a>release likely, thus marking the first time in many years that the game can be bought legitimately without the need for second-hand copies or legally dubious downloads. As is customary for titles released through GOG, the game has received bug-fixing polishes and has been adapted to run natively on modern versions of Windows with little set-up required on the customer's behalf.</p><p>As of May 11th, 2013, System Shock 2 is now available on Steam with better compatibility to make it work on the latest operating systems while still allowing user-made modifications to be applied. It also contains additional material such as the game's soundtrack, maps of the Von Braun, and the original pitch document for the game.</p><h2>Sequel</h2><p>Following the acquisition of rights by Night Dive Studios, a sequel to System Shock 2 is now in development. <a href=\"/system-shock-3/3030-51759/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-51759\">System Shock 3</a> is being developed by <a href=\"/otherside-entertainment/3010-10785/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-10785\">OtherSide Entertainment</a>, a studio populated by an assortment of developers who worked on System Shock 2 as part of <a href=\"/looking-glass-studios-inc/3010-2858/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2858\">Looking Glass Studios</a>.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>System Shock 2 contains a range of weaponry and armor.

It was released on MS-DOS, Windows 95, Mac OS, Mac OS X and Amiga. A PlayStation port of the game was also planned, but due to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony</a>'s policies regarding ports from other platforms at the time, as well the platform's limited hardware and controller, the game was remade from scratch with 36 new levels and released under the name <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/descent-maximum/3030-15187/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15187\">Descent Maximum </a>in the US (it was still released as <em>Descent II</em> in Europe).</p><p>In the game, players take control of the <a href=\"/material-defender/3005-1209/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1209\">Material Defender</a> on another mission given to him by the Post Terran Mineral Corporation (PTMC).</p><p>As of 2006, the game is available on the online game service GameTap, and since 2008 it has been available on<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gogcom/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\"> GOG</a> as a bundle with the first game. On February 19, 2014, it was released on <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a>, one week after the first <a href=\"/descent/3030-17071/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17071\">Descent</a>. Both the GOG and Steam versions use the<em> Infinite Abyss</em> release of the game, which has fewer music tracks than the original release, most noticeably cutting out most of the licensed music (there were originally three tracks by Nivek Ogre, and one by Type-O Negative, the Infinite Abyss release only has one of Nivek Ogre's tracks), but featuring longer mixes of the remaining songs.</p><p>Descent II was originally planned as an expansion to <a href=\"/descent/3030-17071/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17071\">Descent</a>, but it eventually evolved into a full game.

As the player explore tunnels and mines as the Material Defender, many enemies must be destroyed in order to proceed. A variety of weapons and upgrades can be gathered to further speed up the destruction of these foes. To find the core of the level, certain color-coded keys have to be found as well. Once the core is found and destroyed, a countdown timer begins, and the player has a certain amount of time to find the exit, and escape the level. Every four levels, instead of a core reactor, there is a boss. The boss must then be defeated as a core reactor would be destroyed. There are six bosses in total throughout the game.</p><p>Saving can be done at any time. It saves the exact location of the player, all items, weapons, enemies, and the Guide-Bot.</p><p>The Guide-Bot is a new feature in Descent II. It serves as a companion robot that leads the player to objectives in the mission. The Guide-Bot shoots flares that can injure both the player and enemies. It is invulnerable to laser fire, but a large amount of missiles from the player or enemies can destroy it.</p><p>Another new appearance in the game is the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/thief-bot/3015-5600/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5600\">Thief-bot</a>, which will roam around the level, sneak up on the player and steal some of their weapons or equipment, but never downright attacking the player. When fired upon, the Thief-bot will try to run away, and the player has to chase it down if they want to return their precious equipment.</p><h3>Planets</h3><ul><li>Zeta Aquilae</li><li>Quartzon</li><li>Brimspark</li><li>Limefrost Spiral</li><li>Baloris Prime</li><li>Omega (divided into two: Puuma Sphere and Tycho Brahe)</li></ul><h3>Levels</h3><ul><li>Level 1: Ahayweh Gate</li><li>Level 2: Turnabout Bore</li><li>Level 3: Wenl Mine</li><li>Level 4: Robby Station</li><li>Secret Level 1: Segment City</li><li>Level 5: Seaspring Gorge</li><li>Level 6: The Well</li><li>Level 7: Coralbank Quarry</li><li>Level 8: Riverbed Mine</li><li>Secret Level 2: Hurdle Chase</li><li>Level 9: Firewalker Mine</li><li>Level 10: Lavafalls Extraction Ctr.</li><li>Level 11: Coalbank Shaft</li><li>Level 12: Magnacore Station</li><li>Secret Level 3: Mephisto Hardcore</li><li>Level 13: Sleetstone Tunnels</li><li>Level 14: Arcticon Corridor</li><li>Level 15: Icehammer Caverns</li><li>Level 16: Terrafrost Catacombs</li><li>Secret Level 4: Galacia Caverns</li><li>Level 17: Y'tor III</li><li>Level 18: Drec'nilbie K'luh</li><li>Level 19: Nep-Hilim S'crub</li><li>Level 20: Gytowt Station</li><li>Secret Level 5: Ascent Level 1</li><li>Level 21: N'neri Ring</li><li>Level 22: Kwod A'rior</li><li>Level 23: Iwihml</li><li>Level 24: Tycho Brahe</li><li>Secret Level 6: Chain Reaction</li></ul><h2>Music</h2><p>The PC version of Descent II featured two different options for music playback, the player could either choose to listen to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/redbook-audio/3015-6487/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6487\">redbook CD</a> audio on the game discs, or an MIDI soundtrack available for users who couldn't play CD audio (which often required a special audio cable between the CD-ROM drive and the sound card in 1996), or hadn't done a full install, requiring the game to load from the disc during play. Unlike Descent 1, where the PS1 and Mac versions had CD audio remixes of the PC version's MIDI music, Descent II's CD music is entirely different from the MIDI music. Like Descent 1, there were separate MIDI songs for every level in the game, but only 14 (in some releases, only 8) CD tracks, making the music repeat on several levels throughout the game.</p><p>The game's redbook soundtrack was largely composed by<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-580\"> Interplay</a>'s in-house musicians <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/brian-luzietti/3040-10973/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-10973\">Brian Luzietti</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/larry-peacock/3040-12642/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12642\">Larry Peacock</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/johann-langlie/3040-12641/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12641\">Johann Langlie</a>, while the MIDI music was composed by <a href=\"/dan-wentz/3040-12639/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12639\">Daniel Wentz</a>, but a selection of licensed music by Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy, Mark Walk and Type-O Negative also were included (some of it was re-used from the Mac and PlayStation versions of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/descent/3030-17071/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17071\">Descent</a>, which also had <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/redbook-audio/3015-6487/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6487\">redbook audio</a>, unlike the original PC release). The music during the game's <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> was composed by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/peter-rotter/3040-12643/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-12643\">Peter Rotter</a>.</p><p>Many releases and re-prints of Descent II and it's expansion pack Vertigo have slightly different track lists, some with the songs in different orders, or with slightly extended mixes of some songs. The original release combines the title song and the next song, Crawl, into the same track (track 2, as track 1 on <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/redbook-audio/3015-6487/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6487\">Redbook</a> discs are used for the game data), while the <em>Descent Definite Collection</em> and <em>Infinite Abyss</em> releases split them up into separate CD tracks. The track names for the music were supplied in the game's <em>read-me</em> file. Track listing for all the known variations are listed below (Interplay used to host an MP3 version of the original redbook soundtrack on their website, as a goodie for their fans, but had mixed up the tracks Techno Industry and Robot Jungle on that release):</p><h4>Original Soundtrack</h4><ol><li>Game Data</li><li><strong>Title</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Crawl</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Glut</strong> by Ogre of Skinny Puppy &amp; Mark Walk</li><li><strong>Gunner Down</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Cold Reality</strong> by Larry Peacock, Brad Cross, and Leslie Spitzer</li><li><strong>Ratzez</strong> by Nivek Ogre/Skinny Puppy &amp; Mark Walk</li><li><strong>Crush</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Untitled Track</strong> by Mark Morgan</li><li><strong>Haunted (Instrumental Remix)</strong> by Type O Negative</li><li><strong>Are You Descent?</strong> by Ron Valdez</li><li><strong>Techno Industry</strong> by Johann Langlie</li><li><strong>Robot Jungle</strong> by Johann Langlie</li></ol><h4>Definite Collection/Infinite Abyss Soundtrack (Descent II)</h4><ol><li>Game Data</li><li><strong>Title</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Cold Reality (Extended Remix)</strong> by Larry Peacock, Brad Cross &amp; Leslie Spitzer</li><li><strong>Crawl (Extended Remix)</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Gunner Down (Extended Remix)</strong> by Brian Luzietti</li><li><strong>Ratzes (Extended Remix)</strong> by Nivek Ogre/Skinny Puppy and Mark Walk</li><li><strong>Techno Industry (Extended Remix)</strong> by Johann Langlie</li><li><strong>Are You Descent?

It fires at a slower rate than the Vulcan Cannon, though, so overall it uses less ammo.</p><h4>Helix Cannon</h4><p>- A fast-firing, rotating cannon that is similar to the Spreadfire Cannon.</p><h4>Phoenix Cannon</h4><p>- Fast-firing energy bolts that bounce of walls, allowing the player to hit enemies multiple times.</p><h4>Omega Cannon</h4><p>- This cannon shoots homing lightning bolts that temporarily blinds the target.</p><h3>Secondary Weapons</h3><h4>Flash Missile</h4><p>- A weak missile that temporarily stuns the target.</p><h4>Guided Missile</h4><p>- Can either be guided by the player or turned into a regular homing missile.</p><h4>Smart Mine</h4><p>- Similar to a Proximity Bomb; releases homing pulses.</p><h4>Mercury Missile</h4><p>- Fastest of all missiles, but it doesn't home in on targets.</p><h4>Earthshaker Missile</h4><p>- Initial impact shakes the entire level; it leaves an afterburner trail and releases smaller homing missiles.</p><h3>Items</h3><h4>Shield</h4><p>- The trademark blue spheres. Varying amounts of these are scattered around the level, depending on what level the player is on.</p><h4>Energy</h4><p>- Flashing yellow stars that give certain amounts of energy.</p><h4>Afterburner</h4><p>- A new item for Descent II that allows for the player to fly quicker.</p><h4>Converter</h4><p>- A new item for Descent II that transfers energy into shield at a rate of two energy to one shield as long as the player has more than 100 energy (thus making it impossible to infinitely charge the shields using energy recharge stations, which will only boost charge you to 100 points).</p><h4>Cloaking Device</h4><p>- Makes the player invisible for about thirty seconds.</p><h4>Headlight</h4><p>- Improves lighting by a lot, but steadily uses energy.</p><h4>Extra Life</h4><p>- A green sphere with the ship inside it. Gains the player an extra life.</p><h4>Invulnerability</h4><p>- Makes the player invincible for about thirty seconds.</p><h4>Ammo Rack</h4><p>- Doubles the amount of ammo space.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66643/2558732-4183415848-\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2558732\" style=\"width: 1440px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66643/2558732-4183415848-\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2558732\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66643/2558732-4183415848-\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 1440w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66643/2558732-4183415848-\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 1440w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66643/2558732-4183415848- 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Like <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> before it, Descent offers excellent competitive or co-op multiplayer game play over a LAN for up to 8 players. Descent is also touted as being one of the first games that allowed on-the-fly joining of multiplayer games, whereas in Doom it is presumed that all players have to be queued prior to initiating the match. With the advent of the Internet, IPX emulators such as Kali and Kahn which actually combined better compression for IPX games with its own IRC network for users to meet in a standalone client, more and more people began to play Descent and Descent II over the Internet. Descent II was especially popular online due to its support for short packets and variable packet rate -- options which were crucial for smooth Internet play.</p><p>Among the competitive modes are anarchy (<a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch</a>), team anarchy, robo-anarchy (free for all deathmatch that also spawns all the robots from the singleplayer/co-op missions), <a href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-25\">capture the flag</a>, and added with the Vertigo expansion were Hoard and Team Hoard modes, where players need to collect as many shield spheres as possible.</p><h2>Reception</h2><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\"><p>If you don't like Descent at least a little bit, make no mistake, there is something wrong with you.

Gamespot's Chris Hudak gave the game a score of 9.2, praising the network play, the addition of the guide bot and the soundtrack.</p><h2><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/descent-ii-vertigo-series/3030-16572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16572\">Descent II: The Vertigo series</a></h2><p><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/descent-ii-vertigo-series/3030-16572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16572\">Descent II: Vertigo Series</a> is an add-on for Descent II containing twenty additional levels (and three secret levels), plus the officially licensed Descent II: Mission Builder by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/brainware/3010-8687/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8687\">Brainware</a>. Remixed versions of some music tracks from the original Descent II were also included on the CD in Redbook CD-audio format, an interesting addition to what is a simple level pack. It was lauded for its creative level design and the introduction of many exotic robots and two new bosses though some levels also borrowed robots from Descent. \"Flickering\" lights were also a new feature to visual effects. Descent II Vertigo was included in the <em>Descent Definite Collection</em>, but not in any subsequent releases, such as the 2008 <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gogcom/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com</a> release.</p><h2>Descent Mission Builder 2</h2><p>An authorized level editor for Descent 1 and 2 gave users the tools necessary to design, create and implement levels for the commercial versions of Descent and Descent II, and was shipped with some releases of Descent II and Vertigo. The original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/descent-mission-builder/3030-38398/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38398\">Descent Mission Builder </a>was also available as a separate retail release. Levels consist of a series of cubes that the player gets to texture, light up and join with other cubes, the cubes' size can be changed, as can their shape, and the faces can be turned into triggers, doors and destructible walls. Blinking sequences for the flickering lights could also be created in the editor. This program is also capable of converting original Descent missions into Descent II missions, import player created textures (as .BMP files) or new music (only replacing the PC version's alternate MIDI soundtrack, not the redbook audio).</p><h2>Minimum System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel 486DX 50MHz or faster</li><li><strong>Graphics</strong>: 256 color VGA or SVGA monitor</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8MB for DOS or 16MB for Windows</li><li><strong>Operating System</strong>: DOS 5.0 or Windows 95</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Install Requirement</strong>: At least 30MB</li><li><strong>Optical Drive Speed</strong>: 2x CD-ROM</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: Spare time... lots of it.</li></ul><h2>Recommended System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Pentium 90MHz or faster</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16MB RAM</li><li><strong>Sound Card</strong>: Stereo 16-Bit sound card with MIDI support</li><li><strong>Optimal game controller</strong>: A joystick with twist function</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Install</strong>: Full install at 300MB</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: A player who is not prone to motion-sickness</li></ul><h2>Source code release</h2><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\"><p>Here, finally, is the source for Descent II.

The game starts off with Barney riding a tram very similar to the one that Gordon rides in Half-Life. Barney collects his uniform and firearm from the sector 3 security room and goes to work. Throughout the first part of the game you see how Black Mesa has been falling apart. Barney is asked to go fix a mechanical problem when he finds himself stuck on an elevator during the beginning of the resonance cascade. Barney fights his way through Black Mesa with his only goal being to find a way out. Barney saves some scientists (among them is Dr. Rosenberg from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22690\" href=\"/half-life-decay/3030-22690/\">Half-Life:</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22690\" href=\"/half-life-decay/3030-22690/\">Decay</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-641\" href=\"/isaac-kleiner/3005-641/\">Issac Kleiner</a>) from a group of Marines and they come up with a plan to escape Black Mesa.</p><p>The plan is to find an old prototype teleporter and use it to teleport outside of Black Mesa. Barney is briefly sent to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-75\" href=\"/xen/3035-75/\">Xen</a> to turn on a triangulation device that will allow their teleporter to work. Calhoun defends the scientists from the Marines and aliens as they make their escape.

first-person shooter developed by <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id</a> and published by <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda</a> for the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on May 13, 2016.</p><p>Previously referred to as <em>Doom 4</em>, Doom is the fourth mainline title in <a href=\"/doom/3025-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-156\">the franchise of the same name</a> and <a href=\"/franchise-reboot/3015-4151/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4151\">the second reboot</a>. Running on the <a href=\"/id-tech-6/3015-8504/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8504\">id Tech 6</a> engine, the game harkens back to the <a href=\"/twitch-aim/3015-4752/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4752\">fast-paced philosophy</a> of the early Doom installments, avoiding the slower <a href=\"/survival-horror/3015-4801/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival-horror</a> mechanics of <a href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\">Doom 3</a>. Along with a single-player campaign, the game features standard <a href=\"/weapon-slot-loadout/3015-2629/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2629\">loadout</a>-based multiplayer co-developed by <a href=\"/certain-affinity/3010-6279/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6279\">Certain Affinity</a>, and a detailed <a href=\"/in-game-map-editor/3015-269/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-269\">level creation</a> system co-developed by <a href=\"/escalation-studios/3010-6702/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6702\">Escalation</a> called \"SnapMap\".</p><p>Set on a <a href=\"/union-aerospace-corporation/3015-5646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5646\">Union Aerospace Corporation</a> (UAC) research facility on <a href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4\">Mars</a> overrun by <a href=\"/demon/3015-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-557\">the forces</a> of <a href=\"/hell/3035-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-24\">Hell</a>, the campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious <a href=\"/silent-protagonist/3015-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">silent protagonist</a> known as the <a href=\"/doomguy/3005-842/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-842\">Doom Slayer</a>. It follows him as he fights his way through the facility and through Hell itself to close the portals, while upgrading both his Praetor suit and his extensive array of weaponry.</p><p>A small chunk of the multiplayer portion of the game received two periods of beta testing: a closed beta in early April of 2016 for those who pre-ordered <a href=\"/wolfenstein-the-new-order/3030-42581/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42581\">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>, and an open beta two weeks later.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>At the Quake Con 2014 unveil it was revealed that the game focuses on high speed movement and run &amp; gun gameplay like the original Doom, and also features a deep combat melee system, including execution animations. There is no regen health system, thus the player will be forced to pick up health from fallen enemies in order to regain health. This gore kill system, initiated by dealing damage to enemies and then performing a melee attack, is meant to keep the action moving forward. The player is encouraged to play aggressively in order to re-supply and regain health.</p><p>Much like classic games of the '90s players will be able to hold all their weapons simultaneously, instead of the typical two primaries and a sidearm variant found in most modern shooters of today. Most major weapons have mods that can be attached by finding a modding droid within the level that add additional attacks such as the double tap for the super shotgun. One of the bigger changes is that both the chainsaw and BFG are assigned to their own unique keys and use unique ammo, making them go-to weapons for tougher foes or overwhelming odds.</p><p>Exploration will once again play a key role in Doom with secrets making a big return to the series. Each level will have various secret areas strewn throughout that reward the players with a variety of bonuses. These can range from getting weapons early, collecting armor upgrades that grant passive abilities, or discovering runes that allow the player to take part in instanced challenge rooms that unlock further gameplay abilities. The number of secrets available on each level can always be checked using the map, encouraging players to always go back and look around before moving on with the story.</p><p>id Software has stated that the campaign will be longer than 13 hours and feature an extreme difficulty mode called Ultra-Nightmare. During a play through in Ultra-Nightmare, a death is permanent causing the player to completely start their campaign over from the beginning of the game.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Certain Affinity co-developed the multiplayer which includes several classic modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, as well as freeze tag, domination, and warpath. Along with traditional gameplay modes, players can expect to locate power-ups, health packs, and jump pads in arenas that were familiar in older id Software games such as Quake. Players can also locate a pentagram that transforms them into a giant demon.</p><p>Doom launched with nine multiplayer maps, but included an in-game tool called \"Doom SnapMap\". SnapMap allows players to create new multiplayer maps and new game modes, which are all able to be shared to the online community.</p><p>Strong criticisms were cast during the multiplayer beta test due to the similarities to Halo's multiplayer from armor design to 2-weapon layouts instead of sticking with the more traditional arena modes found in previous games.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>At QuakeCon 2008, id announced that Doom 4 will not be available through <a href=\"/digital-distribution/3015-2329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2329\">digital distribution</a> like many of the company's previous titles. At the press conference, id Software co-founder <a href=\"/john-carmack/3040-4576/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4576\">John Carmack</a> announced that Doom 4 would have \"three times as much horsepower as <a href=\"/rage/3030-20672/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20672\">RAGE</a>\". The game was then said to run at only 30 frames a second, but despite this, Carmack promised to raise the bar on video game graphics to a level \"no one has ever seen before.\" Later in the event, id CEO <a href=\"/todd-hollenshead/3040-14696/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14696\">Todd Hollenshead</a> contradicted Carmack in a way when he announced id is \"not even sure if Doom 4 will be Doom 4.\"</p><p>At Quake-con 2014 a private showing of the game wowed Doom fans, but no footage surfaced for the public's viewing pleasure. In a interview it was stated nothing would be shown until 2015.</p><p>In interviews John Carmack has implied that the gameplay was to be more action-oriented than the previous title, and looks to shy away from the survival horror elements of <a href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\">Doom 3</a>. Namely the excessive darkness, monsters 'hiding in <a href=\"/monster-closet/3015-1205/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1205\">closets</a>', and the relatively limited amount of ammo available.</p><p>Early interviews suggest this move away from survival horror to Doom's more traditional focus on action:</p><blockquote><p>You get to punctuate a lot more with triumphs and successes, and you just don't get to do that very much in survival horror. You know, you want to say, 'I'm victorious,' not, 'I'm not dead.' It's just a fundamentally more rewarding genre to be in.</p></blockquote><h2>Movie</h2><p>Personnel within id software have expressed interest in making a new Doom movie that actually follows the <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> storyline, unlike the original <a href=\"/tang-doom/2300-457/\" data-ref-id=\"2300-457\">Doom movie</a> starring <a href=\"/the-rock/3005-1674/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1674\">The Rock</a>. Todd Hollenshead has openly aired his interest in a possible Doom movie following the storyline of Doom 4 itself, whatever that may be. He hopes that the hype for Doom 4 will encourage Universal Studios into talks about the project's possibility.</p>", "releases": [{"api_detail_url":

href=\"../../shigeru-miyamoto/72-614/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and published by <a href=\"../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo</a>. The game was released in 1985 for the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Super Mario Bros. has gone on to be considered by many to be one of the best platformers ever created. The <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gamers/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Guinness World Records Gamer\u2019s Edition</a>, a record keeping organization, declared Super Mario Bros. for the NES as the <a href=\"../../best-selling-games/92-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> best selling</a> video game of all time with more than 40 million copies sold worldwide.</p><p>Super Mario Bros. has two direct sequels, numerous spin-offs, and has also crossed mediums--most notably into television and movies. <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, the movie, was the first <a href=\"../../games-on-which-movies-are-based/92-1019/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> movie to be based on a video game</a>. <a href=\"../../mario/94-177/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mario</a>, the main character of the game, is one of Nintendo\u2019s most recognizable mascots, and has become so famous that he is recognized worldwide.</p><p>The game has been released in a variety of forms. It has been released on the <a href=\"../../game-boy-advance/60-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"../../snes/93-2795/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href=\"../../nes/93-2794/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href=\"../../virtual-console/92-2925/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wii Virtual Console</a>, and has been featured in <a href=\"../../animal-crossing/61-12893/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Animal Crossing</a> as a game that can be obtained through use of an <a href=\"/pro-action-replay/3000-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-22\"> Action Replay</a>. The game was later repackaged in <a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars/3030-18529/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18529\"> Super Mario All-Stars</a>, along with several other early <a href=\"/super-mario/3025-643/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-643\"> Super Mario</a> games.</p><p>The music for the game is composed by <a href=\"../../koji-kondo/72-606/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koji Kondo</a>, also well known for his compositions in games such as <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\"> The Legend of Zelda</a>. The game's iconic \"Ground Theme\" has been used in dozens of games since, and it is now considered the \"theme song\" of the <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\"> Mario</a> series. The game's other songs, such as the Starman theme, underwater, underground, the game over jingle, and the castle themes have also been featured in dozens of future games, not limited to the Mario series.</p><h2>Story</h2><p><a href=\"../../the-mushroom-kingdom/95-14/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Mushroom Kingdom</a> is invaded by the <a href=\"../../koopa/92-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopas</a>. The Koopas are a tribe of turtle-like creatures versed in the ways of black magic. Using their black magic abilities they have turned all the Mushroom people into various objects like stones and bricks. Their leader, the evil Koopa King <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bowser</a>, has kidnapped the only person who can undo the black magic that has trapped the Mushroom people, <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"> Princess Toadstool</a>. Mario hears of the plight of the Mushroom people, grabs his brother <a href=\"../../luigi/94-370/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Luigi</a>, and sets out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. is simple. The game has eight worlds, and each world has four sub-levels. Basically, Mario must travel through all eight worlds, avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way. At the end of each world is a castle, in which Mario must fight one of Bowser\u2019s evil minions; with the exception of the last castle in which Mario fights Bowser himself.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\"><img alt=\"Mario swims through World 2-2.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Mario swims through World 2-2.</figcaption></figure><p>There were also several chances to <a href=\"../../warping/92-852/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Warp</a> ahead and skip levels. World 1-2 had the ability to warp to Worlds 2, 3 or 4, and World 4-2 had the ability to warp worlds 6, 7 and 8. This allowed for the <a href=\"../../speedrun/92-179/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Speedruns</a> to become common.</p><p>The weapons in Mario's arsenal are not vast by any means. Mario can <a href=\"../../jump/92-379/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> jump</a> on enemy\u2019s heads, shoot <a href=\"../../fireball/93-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> fireballs</a> (by picking up a Fire Flower) at them, or use \u201cStar Power\u201d by picking up a Starman, which makes him an <a href=\"../../temporary-invincibility/92-266/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> invincible machine of destruction</a>, laying waste to everything in his path. Mario can also use the occasional <a href=\"../../koopa-shell/93-309/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopa shell</a> to kill enemies. This four pronged offensive is how Mario will dispatch of most enemies, with the exception of Bowser and his castle minions. When it comes to the bosses of the game there is another way of dealing with them that is presented. Jumping on their heads will only get Mario killed, and there are no Starmen to be had during these instances. They can be killed with fireballs, if Mario somehow makes it to the end of the level with with that ability; but if Mario doesn't, there aren't many other approaches to dispatching these enemies.</p><p>Mario begins the game with 3 lives, and can earn more by obtaining 1-up mushrooms, collecting 100 <a href=\"../../coin/93-219/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> coins</a>, or by jumping on multiple enemies (or a single enemy multiple times) without touching the ground. It is possible to earn many lives very quickly by using exploits such as repeatedly jumping on a Koopa shell, kicking it into a block, and jumping on it again as it returns. If Mario loses all his lives, the player is returned to the start screen.</p><p>All of the the bosses in the game are standing on bridges over pits of lava, blocking the way to the end of the level. At the end of each bridge is an ax. Using a platform above the boss or running underneath the boss when he jumps, and then touching the ax at the end of the bridge will cause the bridge to collapse, sending the boss into the lava below.</p><p>After each one of the \u201cboss\u201d battles a mushroom retainer (aka <a href=\"../../toads/92-3369/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Toads</a>) is saved who says this <a href=\"../../meme-origin/92-2420/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> famous line</a>, \u201cThank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!\u201d The exception is, of course, when Mario finally beats Bowser in World 8-4 and rescues <a href=\"../../princess-peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Princess Peach</a>.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a> </strong>- Main character of the game.

Super Mario Bros</a></em>, a positive review.<sup><br /></sup></p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Super Mario Bros. (and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a \"video game console,\" the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.</p><p>The game popularized the \"side-scrolling platformer\" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.</p><p>Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official \"top games of all time\" lists, including lists from publications such as <i>Nintendo Power</i>, <i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i>, IGN, Screw Attack, <i>Game Informer</i>, and many, many more.</p><h4>Release Date Controversy</h4><p>There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.</p><p>Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in <a href=\"/super-smash-bros-brawl/3030-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20588\"> Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>'s \"Chronicle\" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.</p><p> </p>", "deck": "Focusing on a humble plumber and his brother setting out to rescue a Princess who has been kidnapped by a vile lizard king, Super Mario Bros. is a platformer created by Shigeru Miyamoto, published by Nintendo, and is one of the best-selling video games of all time.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/", "name": "Super Mario Bros.", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-15544/", "number_of_user_reviews": 16, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-4/", "abbreviation": "GBA", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/", "id": 4, "name": "Game Boy Advance"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/", "abbreviation": "ARC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/", "id": 84, "name": "Arcade"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/", "abbreviation": "WSHP", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/", "id": 87, "name": "Wii Shop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-91/", "abbreviation": "FDS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/", "id": 91, "name": "Famicom Disk System"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-138/", "abbreviation": "3DSE", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds-eshop/3045-138/", "id": 138, "name": "Nintendo 3DS eShop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:21:45", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 15544, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "SMB"}, "platform": "NES", "title": "Super Mario Bros."}, {"duration": "0:12:00", "runner": "darbian, Kosmicd12, andrewg", "data": {"original_release_date": "1986-06-03 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2015-10-29 23:05:31", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/391459-1178034648_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391459\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/391459-1178034648_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391459\"><img alt=\"Beware the Poison Mushroom!\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/391459-1178034648_01.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/391459-1178034648_01.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Beware the Poison Mushroom!</figcaption></figure><p>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (known in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 2: For Super Players) is a platforming game developed and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> for the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Family Computer Disk System</a> (in Japan only) on May 3, 1986.

However, the gameplay is a major departure from said formula in one aspect: the introduction of Mario\u2019s hydro-pumping backpack, <a href=\"/fludd/3005-3534/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3534\"> F.L.U.D.D.</a></p><p>Mario utilizes F.L.U.D.D. throughout a majority of the game, and can apply it to a wide variety of different uses \u2013 most notably, the ability to Squirt objects and enemies that are due for a good rinse, as well as the ability to hover, which allows for a safe recovery from dangerous falls, and provides the aptitude to reach previously inaccessible areas.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340261-sms_delfino.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340261\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5243902439024\" data-width=\"328\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 328px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340261-sms_delfino.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340261\"><img alt=\"Mario sweeping Delfino by surprise\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340261-sms_delfino.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340261-sms_delfino.jpg 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-width=\"419\"></a><figcaption>Mario sweeping Delfino by surprise</figcaption></figure><p>Super Mario Sunshine has gameplay similar to previous Super Mario game, Super Mario 64. As with every <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a> game, however, it adds new gameplay aspects and features. Likely the most important upgrade is the addition of F.L.U.D.D. (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device). F.L.U.D.D. is a pack that Mario wears that can either spray water or use water power to have Mario hover. Other nozzles can be unlocked later: the Rocket Nozzle and the Turbo Nozzle. The Rocket Nozzle can shoot Mario several hundred feet into the air. The Turbo Nozzle can allow Mario to run at incredible speeds, even allowing him to run on water and break through thing s like doors.</p><p>Mario can also enlist the aid of <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\"> Yoshi</a>. When riding Yoshi, he can eat enemies, fruit, and even birds. Some of the birds grant a <a href=\"/shine-sprite/3055-1984/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1984\">Shine Sprite</a> upon being eaten, while others give coins. After eating fruit, Yoshi can spit juice from the fruit. This juice can dissolve large orange blocks, which are obstacles blocking certain secret areas. The juice can also turn enemies into platforms. Based on the type of fruit, the color and effect of the juice are different. Yoshi can die in two ways that Mario can't: without eating fruit, Yoshi will die, and when Yoshi touches the water, he dies.</p><p>The primary goal of Super Mario Sunshine is to collect Shine Sprites. These are in a variety of smaller levels, from the hub world of Delfino Plaza. Each Shine Sprite can be acquired by doing a specific task in the level. Every level has eight such tasks to be completed. After collecting a large enough amount of Shine Sprites, a new level is unlocked, Mario gets a new ability, or an event related to the plot. Shine Sprites can be collected in other ways, such as gathering enough blue coins (scattered around <a href=\"/isle-delfino/3035-494/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-494\"> Isle Delfino</a>) or eating certain birds.

Soon after, they are given the world spanning task of collecting four Orbs of Light and defeating four fiends. The fiends went by the names of Lich, Kary, Kraken, and Tiamat. They had taken the Orbs from the rightful place they belonged and spread corruption over all the lands, skies, and seas. After many battles the Light warriors had collected items, gold and experience. When all the fiends were defeated, it was revealed that they took Garland\u2019s corpse and sent it back in time. He had now become a mass of living evil known as Chaos. Confusingly Chaos sent the four fiends into the future where they currently plagued the world. Only when Chaos was defeated in the past and the four fiends were defeated in the present, was the world's natural balance finally restored.</p><p>Final Fantasy was originally considered overbearingly difficult. Saves only came at resting in a Town\u2019s Inn or using an expensive item known as a House. Spells in the late game cost more than half a million gil, and had a limited number of charges that could only be replenished by resting. Monster encounters could go from simplistic to overpowering at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 544px\" data-ratio=\"0.77941176470588\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\"><img alt=\" Fighting wolves in the MSX version.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 544w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Fighting wolves in the MSX version.</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks were played out in turn based combat. All characters and monsters all were told what to do before the round began, be it cast a spell, use an item, or commit a basic attack, and all actions were then played out from the fastest person on the battlefield to the slowest. In the original game, some attacks could be useless. For example, if a Fighter and a Thief were both instructed to attack a goblin they would both do so. If the Thief killed him, it wouldn't stop the fighter from doing exactly as he was told by swinging his sword at the space the goblin once stood instead of at the other enemies present. This was later altered in the re-releases for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, and <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> versions, so the attacker would automatically attack the next available target.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\"><img alt=\" Crafting a party from six available classes.

These classes could be upgraded by the Dragon King, to; White Wizard, Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Ninja, Knight, and Master. Players traveled the world in vehicles, such as; boats, airships, and canoes. In combat, up to 9 monsters of various types could battle the player's party. Unless they soared through the skies in an airship or strolled in a safe area like a town, 'random encounters' were always possible. In these Encounters, a band of monsters could emerge and strike the party. Mages had a limited amount of spells they could learn.</p><p>Final Fantasy had almost 20 musical tracks. Some of which, like the tune played after 'Victorious battle' and the 'Opening Theme', remained in one form or another in Final Fantasy games for decades to come.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The music for Final Fantasy was composed by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Some of the tracks became the trademarks to the Final Fantasy series: like the \"Prelude\", played on the title screen, and the \"Victory Fanfare\", which is played after every victorious battle.</p><h2>Version Differences</h2><h3>Wonderswan and PlayStation</h3><p>The <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a> release of Final Fantasy was under the title of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-origins/3030-7866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7866\">Final Fantasy Origins</a> and contained enhanced remakes of both Final Fantasy I and II using higher quality MIDI and cleaner 16-bit graphics. These enhanced remakes were initially ports of the <a href=\"/wonderswan/3045-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-65\">Wonderswan</a> re-releases that never made it to the US for various reasons, most notably because the <a href=\"/wonderswan-color/3045-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-54\">Wonderswan Color</a> was never released in the US. Aside from the obvious graphical face-lift, various changes exist in the PSOne version that differ from the original NES version. An easy mode was created for the original Final Fantasy (increased Gil and EXP curves), auto-re-targeting, a temporary quicksave, and the addition of new items such as <a href=\"/phoenix-down/3055-1009/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1009\">Phoenix Downs</a> (revive a fallen ally) and Gold Needles (remove petrification).</p><h3>Game Boy Advance</h3><p>Using the same enhanced graphical look of the PSOne release, the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Gameboy Advance</a> release of Final Fantasy, known as <a href=\"/final-fantasy-i-ii-dawn-of-souls/3030-17928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17928\">Dawn of Souls</a>, was most notable for drastically reducing the difficulty. The version also included bonus dungeons for each game, though the complex battle transitions and music quality were reduced due to the technical limitations of the system. All changes to the battle system of the PSOne release carry over, however the magic system (previously levels of magic \"slots\" with limited number of uses) was changed to use Magic Points instead. Speculative reasons for the changes include Nintendo's fear that an overly difficult RPG would turn away the younger player-base, arguably a larger portion of the overall audience than on the PSOne.</p><h3>PSP</h3><p>The <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> re-release featured the same difficulty reduction and added bonus dungeons of the Gameboy Advance re-release, but featured an even bigger graphical overhaul, with various post-processing effects added such as cloud overcast and hi-res sprites (including spells). However, unlike Origins and Dawn of Souls, these two versions were not sold together and retailed individually at release for $29.99 USD each. Together, these two releases doubled the price of the initial release of both Final Fantasy Origins and Dawn of Souls ($29.99). The price, in addition to the numerous other re-releases of the games on other platforms, resulted in the game receiving much criticism from the gaming press.</p><h3>iPhone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\"><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Giant D-Pad</figcaption></figure><p>On February 25, 2010, Square-Enix released an updated version of this game onto the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> and iPod Touch.

For example, there is a scene in <a href=\"/soldier-of-fortune/3030-22547/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22547\">Soldier of Fortune</a> during which the game can be seen in the background being played by one of the characters.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game takes place in the 2050s, when a rapidly mutating computer virus has infected the defense software that protects the entire planet. To resolve the problem, <a href=\"/scott-oconnor/3005-18348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18348\">Colonel Scott O'Connor</a> is chosen to use the Image Transfer System; an untested technology capable of converting the human mind into binary data and transferring it into a computer.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, because the ITS is untested, the effects on the human mind are unknown. When Scott's psyche materializes inside the computer system, he is rendered as a kabuki actor. The player must take control of O'Connor and guide him through six levels of intense combat in order to reach the heart of the system and a final confrontation with the virus itself high above Earth in an orbiting satellite.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Hair</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s hair can be whipped towards enemies to inflict damage.

A finite number are available in each level for the player to find.</p><h3>Fusion Gun</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fires powerful but slow moving missiles towards enemies for a very long range attack. Very limited ammo capacity.</p><h3>Quantum Bomb</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fires in three directions in front of the player. Very short range but extremely powerful.</p><h3>Dynamite</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thrown forward in parabolic arc making it difficult to land direct hits. Large splash damage effect and power makes it a deadly weapon if on target.</p><h3>Remote Control Bolo</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Automatically targets enemies and lands multiple hits from a single attack. The most powerful weapon in the game and only obtained during the final level.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Tanks</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Patrol slowly but accelerate within close proximity to the player. No ranged ability and easy to avoid makes this a common enemy.</p><h3>Robo Roaches</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Slowly crawl along the ground with no ranged ability; however they are very durable and require many hits to be destroyed.

The controls are the same as in the Mega Man games with few changes: Shoot, jump, run, and switch weapons. However, unlike Mega Man, Francesca/Doropie begins with all the weapons right away, and she can fire in several directions. Francesca/Doropie can also crouch. However, despite the large number of similarities, there are a number of control differences that separate this game from Mega Man. Jumping while standing on a broom is best avoided, as the broom will vanish. Also different from Mega Man is the lack of selectable stages. The game features the ability to charge Doropie's basic shot from the get-go; while <a href=\"/mega-man-2/3030-14026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14026\">Mega Man 2</a> had the ability to charge some weapons (notably Heat Man's) the Mega Man series would not incorporate this as a primary game mechanic until <a href=\"/mega-man-4/3030-8141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8141\">Mega Man 4</a>.</p><p>The Krion Conquest has no continues, but its equivalent Magical Kids Doropie does. </p><h3>Spells</h3><p><b></b>Doropie begins the game with all spells at her disposal.</p><ul><li>Normal: A basic magical bolt. It can be charged to make it stronger.</li><li>Fire: Doropie summons a phoenix to destroy all enemies on the screen. This drains four points of Doropie's life; if she doesn't have enough life remaining, she cannot cast it.</li><li>Freeze: An ice magic. It can be charged to freeze enemies and some obstacles.</li><li>Ball: Magic spheres that ricochet around the room. Good usage of this is vital to pass some obstacles without taking damage.</li><li>By charging, Doropie can create and place a temporary barrier than can absorb enemy shots. It isn't very useful.</li><li>Broom: Vital for the completion of the game. Doropie places a broom and can then control it by shooting in different directions to maneuver through tricky spots. Be careful not to jump while riding it, or it will disappear!</li></ul><h3>Items</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1667765\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0555555555556\" data-width=\"90\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 90px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1667765\"><img alt=\"A 1up. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg 90w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A 1up. \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667765-doropiedoll.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" data-width=\"90\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A 1up. </figcaption></figure><p>There are several items for Doropie to pick up and utilize. </p><ul><li>Small pumpkin: Restores a little of Doropie's life. </li><li>Big pumpkin: Restores a lot of Doropie's life. </li><li>Doropie doll: A 1up.</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Characters</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1667760\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"106\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 106px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1667760\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" data-width=\"106\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg 106w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1667760-doropieface.jpg 106w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" data-width=\"106\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Francesca/Doropie: The heroine.

The game was a departure from previous brawlers with its introduction of <a href=\"/rpg-elements/3015-3603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3603\">RPG elements</a>, <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a> <a href=\"/exploration/3015-767/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-767\">exploration</a>, and <a href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> gameplay, anticipating later sandbox games like <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a>.</p><p>In <i>Ransom</i>, the player takes control of Alex (Kunio) and Ryan (Riki), who must cross River City to reach gang leader \"Slick\" barricaded inside River CIty High. Gameplay is in the style of classic <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling</a> brawlers, namely <a href=\"/double-dragon/3030-20752/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20752\">Double Dragon</a> and Technos' own <a href=\"/renegade/3030-18293/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18293\">Renegade</a>, released the year before. Unique to River CIty Ransom is the ability to collect money from defeated enemies and spend it at shops to regain health or boost <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">RPG-style stats</a>. The player learns new moves and increases their fighting prowess through this system. The game's quirky style of comedy also sets it apart from similar titles - and it could almost be considered a parody of them.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players choose to control Alex or Ryan (or both in two-player <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-operative</a>). Both characters have identical skills, and differ only in appearance. The A button will punch, the B button will kick, and both pressed together will jump. Punches are faster while kicks have longer range, and the two attacks can be improved separately through use of purchased items.</p><p>Two-player mode features both players on screen at the same time. Players can even do certain co-op moves together, including picking up the other player and throwing him into enemies. In nearly all versions, two-player comes with an A and a B mode. In A mode, players can damage each other with their strikes. In B mode, they cannot.</p><p>As with other brawlers, various weapons can be picked up from within the environment or taken off stunned foes. Weapons include pipes, chains, <a href=\"/brass-knuckles/3055-1157/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1157\">knuckle dusters</a>, garbage cans, and even enemies that have been knocked down. Bashing an enemy overhand with the body of another enemy is part of the game's goofy humor. When holding weapons, the A button strikes with that weapon and B throws it directly forward.</p><p>River City has seven major areas, most based around shopping centers. There is no <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> map, but players can freely return to previous areas by retracing their steps. Major areas often lead to smaller areas by pressing \"Up\" in front of alleyways in the background art. These smaller areas act as arenas for the game's bosses, who appear when specific conditions are met. The exception is the final area, River City High, which is made up of three floors plus a final battle on the roof.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191133\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191133\"><img alt=\"River City shop.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>River City shop.</figcaption></figure><p>Shopping malls feature stores in the background, which can be entered by pressing \"Up\" in front of their doors. Money collected off defeated foes can be spent in the shops. Players can buy food, drinks, and medicine to refill health and boost stats. More than one \"serving\" of an item can be bought, and more expensive items will always have a larger effect. Most foods are eaten immediately inside the shop, but some can be ordered \"to go\" - allowing them to be taken along and used within the world from the inventory screen.</p><p>Aside from food items, shops will sell books and shoes. Comic books and magazines will boost stats, while certain special books teach new attacks. The \"Stone Hands\" book, for example, upgrades the player's standard punch to a quick succession of three (for three times the damage). The \"Dragon Feet\" book does the same for kicks. Naturally, these books are very expensive. Shoes boost a combination of kicking power and agility, and are equipped from the inventory screen. They bestow their effects for as long as they are worn.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655863\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 258px\" data-ratio=\"0.62790697674419\" data-width=\"258\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655863\"><img alt=\"Status screen.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" data-width=\"258\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif 258w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Status screen.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif 258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" data-width=\"258\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Status screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Stats are tracked for each of the player characters, and can be viewed in the Status screen. Abilities start at 15 and can be increased (through food and books) to a maximum of 63. Health can be increased to a maximum of 127. The available stats are:</p><ul><li><strong>Punch</strong> - Punching strength</li><li><strong>Kick</strong> - Kicking strength</li><li><strong>Weapon</strong> - Strength of weapon attacks</li><li><strong>Throw</strong> - Damage (not distance) done by thrown objects</li><li><strong>Agility</strong> - Speed and jumping height</li><li><strong>Defense</strong> - Damage reduced by blocking (by holding A or B)</li><li><strong>Strength</strong> - Ability to break an enemy's block.</li><li><strong>Will</strong> <strong>Power</strong> - Recover from being knocked down.</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong> - Current health (restored with food)</li><li><strong>Max</strong> <strong>Power</strong> - Maximum health (boosted with books)</li></ul><p>Each area in River City is controlled by one of nine different gangs, who increase in difficulty as the player goes along. Gang-appropriate names are reused for each member the player fights (ex: Biff, Trip, and Tyler for the \"Frat Guys\" gang), and each gang is easily distinguished by their unique colors. Gangs have different stats and tendencies (Cowboys like to double-team, Jocks favor using weapons), and also drop different amounts of cash for each member's defeat (from $.50 per defeated member up to $1.25 with the toughest gang).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197833\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 248px\" data-ratio=\"0.90725806451613\" data-width=\"248\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197833\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" data-width=\"248\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif 248w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" data-width=\"248\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Bosses also feature prominently, and generally appear in specific areas after the player has beaten up enough of their gang. Bosses take a lot of punishment and dish it out as well, and feature different strategies (similar to their gang) along with occasional unique moves. There are eight boss fights around River City that must be discovered and won before the player is allowed entry into River City High. From there, five more boss fights must be won inside the school, including taking down the mastermind Slick.</p><p>Aside from the stats, another RPG aspect is a limited inclusion of dialogue. Some characters can be spoken to instead of fought with, and bosses will often provide clues. Dialogue runs along the bottom of the screen, and ranges from taunts to enemy groans when defeated (including the notorious \"BARF!\"). Status messages are also updated here, notifying the player when they collect money and when entering a new area. The options screen changes the speed at which these messages are displayed and cleared.</p><p>Progress is saved with a password system, storing only the player's stats. Money earned and bosses defeated are not saved, so the player must start over each time, though with a much stronger character. The password is updated as the game is played, and viewable from the menu screen.</p><h2>Localization</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655861\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 406px\" data-ratio=\"0.69950738916256\" data-width=\"406\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655861\"><img alt=\"Famicom Box Art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg 406w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Famicom Box Art\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg 406w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Famicom Box Art</figcaption></figure><p>As with the previous two games in the series, most of the changes for the Western release involved alterations to the Japanese idea of high-school rivalries (which is not the same in the West).

The high quality of the game and its relative rarity means it now commands a high price among collectors, similarly to <a href=\"/mr-gimmick/3030-6037/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6037\">Gimmick!</a>.</p><p>The player uses four separate heroes, each with their own strengths, to defeat the armies of the Prince of Darkness. Each hero has a tutorial stage that allows the player to get to grips with their special abilities, before the game progresses with the foursome as a team.</p><p>Little Samson was published in the US, Japan and Europe by Taito.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The Prince of Darkness, Ta-Keed, has escaped from his imprisonment and has been terrorizing the countryside as a means of vengeance. Emperor Hans has heard the legend of the Majestic Bells and their bearers and call for the heroes to fight Ta-Keed and his armies!</p><h2>Heroes</h2><p>Heroes are the different characters the player takes control of throughout the game. There are four heroes in total, each with differing abilities and play-styles that are introduced in character specific stages. Upon finishing the introductions the player is able to take control of each of the four heroes, utilizing their strengths as a means to complete the various stages.</p><h3>Little Samson</h3><p>The young human hero, owns the White Bell and uses his mountain-climbing background to allow him to grab on to just about anything! Using this specialty, along with the ability to fire bells while climbing makes Little Samson invaluable to cross almost any terrain available while maintaining a good offensive.</p><h3>Kikira the Dragon Lord</h3><p>Owner of the Blue Bell, Kikira is able to fly for a set amount of time making her perfect for stages with a lot of platform jumping and open space. Kikira's main attack is a fireball breath that increases in power the longer it is held before firing, also changing her body color!</p><h3>Gamm the Rock Lord</h3><p>The biggest, and therefore slowest, of the characters and owner of the Red Bell. Gamm has edge in all-out power. With one single punch, controllable in 4 directions, enemies that could take many hits fall to the feet of the great golem and being the toughest character allows him to even walk across spikes!</p><h3>K.O. the Enchanted Beast</h3><p>The tiny mouse hero, K.O. is the fastest moving character which also give him the lowest health. His stature and ability to climb surfaces, similar to Samson, provide K.O. with the only means to get to hard-to-reach places. Laying time-delay bombs as a weapon prove that tiny does not mean \"weak\".</p><h2>Power-Ups</h2><p>There are few power-ups in the game, however each posses important effects to help the player and stay active for the entirety of play. These power-ups are:</p><ul><li><b>Doll: </b>Gain an extra life.</li><li><b>Potion: </b>Remains available until used. The hero that picks up the potion is the owner and only recipient of it's effects. When used, the potion will restore the owner's full health points.</li><li><b>Big Heart: </b>Restores four health points.</li><li><b>Small Heart: </b>Restores a single health point.</li><li><p><strong>Crystal Ball:</strong> Permanently add two health points to health meter for receiving hero.</p></li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Little Samson is very clearly and unabashedly a <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a> clone. Jumping with the A button and attacking with the B button, players must traverse stages avoiding pit-falls and enemy attacks while collecting power-ups and eventually fight a boss before the next level.

Certain projectiles hitting the player's shield will cause Trojan to temporarily lose his weapons. Once lost, he will have an opportunity to regain them by acquiring the sword/shield icon that will appear on the map.

A Kickstarter campaign ran from September 12, 2013 to October 12, 2013 and was originally asking for $27,000 USD. By the end of the campaign it ended up raising $645,158 for the development of the game and was originally projected to be released in June of 2014.</p><p>PlayStation 4 and XBox One versions were released on 26th July 2016 with Wii U and Vita ports being publicly cancelled in early September.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game begins with a cutscene featuring the eponymous Drifter, who is shown fighting off forces produced by the game's main antagonist, Judgement. The Drifter is plagued by some illness that causes them to cough up blood during confrontations with Judgement throughout the game. The Drifter travels through four main areas of the world, activating beacons of power in order to active the world's central elevator to reach and defeat Judgement before the illness overcomes them.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is a top-down action game that occasionally makes use of Dual-Joystick Shooter/Bullet Hell genre conventions. The Drifter is equipped with a <a href=\"/beam-sword/3055-365/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-365\">laser sword</a>, a dash move, and a pistol. The sword and dash abilities can be upgraded with currency found hidden throughout the world, and the player can find various types of guns scattered across the four areas. With enough upgrade currency the Drifter can purchase skills that enable them to deflect bullets, or engage an endless dash combo. The Drifter can also find various outfits that enable different stat bonuses.</p><h2>The World</h2><p>The world is split into five main areas: Mountains, Lake, Crystal Forest, Barren Hills, and a Central Town that acts as the hub and contains the central elevator to Judgement. Each of the four areas contains four modules to find and a boss character who must be conquered in order to proceed to the final fight with Judgement.</p><h2>External Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.heart-machine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Official site</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hyperlightdrifter\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeartMachineZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Twitter</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZpoG8bVCFb4GL2dsELjXA/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Youtube</a></li></ul>", "deck": "A 2D action-RPG inspired by A Link to the Past and Diablo developed by Heart Machine.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2839123-tumblr_o2pgvtjivz1slr6aoo1_540.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/hyper-light-drifter/3030-43940/", "name": "Hyper Light Drifter", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-43940/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/", "abbreviation": "XONE", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/", "id": 145, "name": "Xbox One"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "date_added": "2013-09-15 08:11:23", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 43940, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": null}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Hyper Light Drifter"}, {"duration": "1:16:00", "runner": "Vulajin, sigma", "data": {"original_release_date": "2015-03-11 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2016-06-14 14:59:23", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2710702\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2710702\"><img alt=\"A screenshot of the game. \" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg 1920w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/18/187968/2710702-y12hvn5d7dgjstua.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of the game. </figcaption></figure><p>Ori And The Blind Forest is a \"Metroidvania\" 2D platformer developed by <a href=\"/moon-studios/3010-7358/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7358\">Moon Studios</a> and published by <a href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft Studios</a>.</p><p>The game has been in development for four years and was released on March 11, 2015 for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>.

Originally released for the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System</a> in Japan on September 26, 1986, Castlevania is the first installment of the long-running <a href=\"/castlevania/3025-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-86\">Castlevania</a> franchise. The player takes control of heroic vampire hunter <a href=\"/simon-belmont/3005-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-86\">Simon Belmont</a>, heir to the mighty <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3055-284/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-284\">Vampire Killer</a> whip, who must battle through a decrepit and unholy castle in the year 1691 to destroy the evil <a href=\"/dracula/3005-348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-348\">Count Dracula</a>. The story of the <a href=\"/belmont-clan/3015-4848/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4848\">Belmont clan</a>, the Vampire Killer whip, and Dracula's countless resurrections have grown with subsequent installments to the Castlevania franchise.</p><p>It is often incorrectly assumed that the <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2</a> version of this game, known as <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3030-290/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-290\">Vampire Killer</a>, is the series' first entry; this is because Vampire Killer was the first Castlevania game to be released outside of Japan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Simon's primary weapon is the Vampire Killer, which starts as a short-range leather <a href=\"/whip/3055-327/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-327\">whip</a>. It can be upgraded to a <a href=\"/flail/3055-1260/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1260\">flail</a>-style chain whip with increased damage by collecting a whip <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-up</a>. The chain whip can be further upgraded by collecting a second power-up to extend its range. Simon can only crack his whip straight ahead to attack enemies with it; however, he can whip while jumping to strike at mid-air targets.</p><p>By collecting <a href=\"/heart/3055-142/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">Hearts</a>, Simon can use one of five <a href=\"/secondary-weapons/3015-3303/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3303\">sub-weapons</a> that can be found by whipping candles or as item drops from defeated enemies. The Dagger is extremely weak, slow, and is more of a hindrance than a help. The Axe is thrown in an upward arc, useful for taking out enemies hiding or flying above Simon. The Holy Water is a short-range \"firebomb\" that can stop enemies in their tracks while doing constant damage. The Cross is a boomerang that covers the entire distance of the screen when thrown. Lastly, the Stopwatch stops all regular enemies in their tracks at a cost of five hearts. All the weapons but the Stopwatch can also be upgraded to a double and triple shot, allowing multiple uses of the weapon at the same time.</p><p>This initial incarnation of Simon also set a standard of stiff movement for Castlevania protagonists. Simon moves at a fixed pace and cannot change his direction in mid-air after a jump. His slow speed is further reduced while climbing stairs, which can leave Simon extremely vulnerable to projectiles or fast-moving enemies. There is a slight delay during jumps between the button press and the corresponding on-screen action; this delay forces the player to be very deliberate while jumping because it requires a particular timing. The restrictive nature of Simon's jump was changed in the <a href=\"/super-castlevania-iv/3030-11443/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11443\">Super Castlevania IV</a> remake, allowing players to alter Simon's direction while in mid-air.</p><h2>Ports, Re-Releases, and Recreations</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724200\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724200\"><img alt=\"The IBM-PC port displayed with CGA graphics\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The IBM-PC port displayed with CGA graphics</figcaption></figure><p>The original NES Castlevania had many ports and re-releases to various computer systems, game consoles, mobile devices, and arcade hardware.

In February 5, 1993, the NES version was released in Japan (prior to that, it had only been released on the FDS), sacrificing the saving and name registration for a new \"Easy\" mode, which gives Simon more time, damage protection, lives, and knockback protection from being damaged. The game was ported to mobile phones three times, each with improved graphics (one in 2002, one in 2004, and one in 2005).</p><p>Castlevania, along with having many ports and re-releases, has also had many recreations spanning a variety of game consoles.

Simon can now whip in eight directions, where he couldn't in the original games. Holding down the attack button allows Simon to flail the whip, thus granting greater ability to block projectiles. Simon can now use his whip to grapple on to hooks, allowing him to swing over various obstacles. Simon can adjust the length of the whip while swinging using the D-pad. Returning to IV are the spike pits, moving platforms, and other obstacles.</p><p>Simon begins the first level with a basic leather whip, which can be upgraded twice through pickups, each increasing length and damage (returning to the short leather whip, should Simon die). Sub-weapons can also be upgraded, up to level three, though these are much rarer than whip upgrades. The sub-weapon upgrades allow Simon to use the equipped item times the level. For example, if the sub-weapon is level two, he can throw two boomerangs instead of one, level three he can throw three etc. Sub-weapon upgrades will reset upon death or picking up a new sub-weapon.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-244422\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75520833333333\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-244422\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 576w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 576w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/244422-63208_2_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The sub-weapons Castlevania is known for make a return in Super Castlevania IV. In IV, sub-weapons are assigned to a button, wheras they were used by pressing up attack in previous games. This change is due to the eight attack directions. The only other game in the series to assign sub-weapons to their own button was <a href=\"/castlevania-bloodlines/3030-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-945\">Castlevania: Bloodlines</a>, as it also featured multiple attack directions. Like previous games, Simon must collect hearts in order to use sub-weapons. The more powerful the weapon, the more hearts it consumes. Hearts can be collected from destructible environmental pieces, such as walls and candles. </p><p>The level design is more fit to the whip's new abilities in Super Castlevania IV. There are several things that must be hit by the whip, in addition to all-new grapple hooks. Simon can use the whip to grab onto the grappling hook, and then swing across the obstacle that is in his way.</p>", "deck": "An enhanced recreation (for the Super Nintendo) of the original Castlevania, retelling Simon Belmont's crusade against Dracula with new levels, content, and gameplay elements.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1773386-box_scv4.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1773386-box_scv4.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1773386-box_scv4.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1773386-box_scv4.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1773386-box_scv4.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1773386-box_scv4.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1773386-box_scv4.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-castlevania-iv/3030-11443/", "name": "Super Castlevania IV", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-11443/", "number_of_user_reviews": 2, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-9/", "abbreviation": "SNES", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/", "id": 9, "name": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/", "abbreviation": "WSHP", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/", "id": 87, "name": "Wii Shop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-156/", "abbreviation": "N3DS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/new-nintendo-3ds/3045-156/", "id": 156, "name": "New Nintendo 3DS"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 15:59:30", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 11443, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "Akumaj\u014d Dracula\r\nSuper Castlevania 4\r\nDevil's Castle Dracula\r\nAkumajou Dracula"}, "platform": "SNES", "title": "Super Castlevania IV"}, {"duration": "0:17:00", "runner": "Skavenger216, Komrade", "data": {"original_release_date": "1993-10-29 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2016-10-14 05:22:10", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406108\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406108\"><img alt=\"Richter Belmont, the game's main protagonist.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406108-mednafen_2006_03_19_18_58_43_64.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Richter Belmont, the game's main protagonist.</figcaption></figure><p>Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (known in Japan as Akumaj\u014d Dracula X: Chi no Rondo, translated to Devil's Castle Dracula X: Rondo of Blood) is an action horror platformer developed and published by <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a> on October 29, 1993 for the <a href=\"/turbografx-cd/3045-53/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-53\">PC-Engine Super CD-ROM\u00b2</a>.

The player takes control of Richter through seven stages full of obstacles and enemies, using his whip to take on any foes. He can extend his whip a bit by pressing forward twice during the whip animation. The player can increase their score by defeating enemies, and collecting bags of money dropped by enemies, or found when destroying candelabras, torches, and lamps. Players will also find hearts hidden in these light sources, which are used when attacking with a sub-weapon. There are many sub-weapons in the game, such as old favorites like the holy water and dagger. Players will be able to, for the first time in the series, use a super attack or \"item crash\" based on the currently held sub-weapon, which will do great damage to all foes on screen, using up a large number of hearts. In addition, Richter has a whip based item crash, which will make him jump forward with a large, burning whip, under special circumstances when he has no sub-weapon. Richter also has a special dodge ability, a jump backwards, away from harm when the player double taps the jump button. Players can also pick up a rosary, which destroys all enemies on screen.</p><p>Similar to its predecessor Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, Rondo of Blood progresses in a linear fashion, but features many branching paths through each level. Many levels feature alternate paths, secret rooms, and every level features an alternative boss battle, each stage featuring two. The game even features a few alternate stages depending on which route Richter takes on a specific stage. There is one alternate stage for each stage in the normal route, though the alternate stages are all accessed in different ways, and some must come after other alternate stages. Most secret passages will hold items useful for Richter, but a few secret rooms are the holding places for maidens Richter must rescue. The four maidens waiting to be rescued are Anette Renard, Maria Renard, Iris, and Tera. Only two of these maidens are really important two the game, those two being the Renard sisters, Maria and Anette. Once Maria is rescued from behind a hidden, locked door on the second stage in the game, she will become a playable character, and plays completely differently than Richter.</p><h3>Gameplay (Maria Renard)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972941\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6984375\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972941\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Maria Renard becomes a playable character in Rondo of Blood when she is rescued from Dracula's minions. Maria calls forth her animal friends to aid her in her vampire hunting. Her primary weapons are small white doves, which she can fire two at a time. The doves will fly out to about the length that Richter's whip reaches, and then come back. The birds will do damage flying out, as well as returning. In addition, Maria can use her doves while moving. Maria can also double jump, giving her more control in the air than Richter. Maria has the ability to slide as well, by pressing the jump button whilst ducking.Maria is also more fragile than Richter, having less life than him, and taking more damage from enemy attacks. Maria will be knocked back further whenever she takes damage from her foes' attacks. On the other hand, she is faster than Richter, and her size makes it easier for her to avoid attacks.</p><p>Maria also has a secret special attack, where her alternate self will come out and do great damage to anything it touches. When Maria gets a game over, she has a special screen. The words \"game over\" will fall normally, but will be in bright colors, and assorted positions. The continue screen is bordered with flowers rather than skulls.</p><h3>Richter's sub-weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242889\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87428571428571\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242889\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 350w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 350w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b>Richter in action</b></p><p><b>Dagger:</b> The weakest of all sub-weapons, yet very fast, and costs a single heart.

The gameplay and story remain the same from the original, though the levels were remade, removed, and rearranged. The prologue level, along with most of the alternate levels, were removed, making the game more like the original Castlevania than the rest of the series. There are only alternate stages for stage 4 and stage 5, now. In addition, the game removed many alternate pathways and bosses, and there are no longer two bosses per stage. All of the boss fights were changed as well, as well as the hiding places for Maria and Anette. Iris and Tera are no longer in the game, and cannot be rescued, and Maria is no longer a playable character. Dracula X also removed the saving function, replacing it with a more traditional password system. Finally, the music was remixed into MIDI, as the cartridge format of the Super Nintendo lacked the storage capacity afforded by the PC Engine's CD-ROM, which utilized Redbook CD audio tracks.</p><h3>Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406060\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406060\"><img alt=\"There is no Japanese in the PSP port\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"There is no Japanese in the PSP port\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There is no Japanese in the PSP port</figcaption></figure><p>The PSP remake of Rondo of Blood remains largely unchanged from the original game. Very few gameplay alterations were made, aside from two new barriers placed in stages as obstacles guarding unlockables featured only in the remake. These unlockables include music, artwork, and even the original Rondo of Blood. Each of the puzzles to save Iris and Anette were also rearranged. The player is also punished if they do not rescue Anette, who will be changed into a vampire who fights Richter if he does not save her. This boss fight replaces the fight against Shaft's ghost at the end of stage 7. Stage 5' was changed, and given a new boss. Dracula also has a new, more powerful third form.</p><p>All of the cutscenes were redone, as have the dialogue and voice acting. The German intro remains the same, played over a new FMV intro movie. Many sounds have been changed, and all of the music has been remixed from the original. Stage 5' features a completely new song to the game, and stage 7 borrows the song \"MoonFight\" from Castlevania Chronicles.</p><p>In the port of the original game, the only changes are the name \"Rondo of Blood\" at the title, and the English dubs for each of the cutscenes. All of the text is changed to English, and is the same as the names of the remake.</p><h2>Easter Eggs</h2><p>On the seventh stage, a particular mirror will show Richter's skeleton!</p><p>The first level will take Richter through the burning remains of his hometown. This town very closely resembles towns from <a href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a>, and is actually a town from that game, the town of Veros.</p><p>On the second level, the room just before the boss is the same room that <a href=\"/simon-belmont/3005-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-86\">Simon Belmont</a> fights the Vampire bat in the original <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Castlevania</a>.</p><p>If the disc was placed in a non-Super CD-equipped PC Engine CD, a stripped-down game of Castlevania could be played, with a note that the player needed the Super CD System Card to play the game proper.</p><figure data-align=\"left\"

structure of platforming based on free-roaming exploration. Like Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, It is also one of the few Castlevania games to use an anime-inspired art style.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A continuation of <a href=\"/castlevania-bloodlines/3030-945/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-945\">Castlevania: Bloodlines</a>, Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is set in 1944, during <a href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II</a>.

Along the way, they encounter <a href=\"/vincent-dorin/3005-4843/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4843\">Vincent Dorin</a> (a monk who serves as the game's shopkeeper), a mysterious spirit known as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/eric-lecarde/3005-2562/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2562\">\"Wind\"</a> (who plays a crucial role in the story as well as a side-quest giver), <a href=\"/death/3005-5581/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5581\">Death</a>, and two mysterious vampire twins: <a href=\"/loretta-lecarde/3005-4847/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4847\">Loretta</a> and <a href=\"/stella-lecarde/3005-4776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4776\">Stella</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Inspired by \"Julius Mode\" in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin introduces the Partner System, which allows the player to switch between two characters on the fly while allowing them to fight simulatenously (both by \"calling\" the partner and by activating the powerful \"Dual Crush\", which functions similar to the \"Item Crash\" in previous Castlevania games). Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is also the first Castlevania game to introduce <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-operative multiplayer</a>, a sub-quest system, and the ability to purchase items from and sell items to other players.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/212745-portraitofruin12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212745\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/212745-portraitofruin12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212745\"><img alt=\"Jonathan and Charlotte team up for an attack\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/212745-portraitofruin12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/212745-portraitofruin12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jonathan and Charlotte team up for an attack</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin has gameplay that is most comparable to its predecessor, Dawn of Sorrow. Portrait of Ruin is a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game. One of the biggest new features is the ability to switch between Jonathan and Charlotte, the two main characters. The two can also use a combined attack called Dual Crush. Their combined abilities are even sometimes needed to get past certain obstacles or puzzles in the game. One such puzzle involves the two jumping on two motorcycles, and then simultaneously dodging obstacles until the motorcycles crash through a wall.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the game, players can be transported to several other areas other than Dracula's Castle through paintings that are all around the castle. These locales include a desert area and an area similar to London. The game also has a bestiary of 155 different enemies, which are spread through the several world. A lot of the enemies are from previous Castlevania games (including some of the bosses).

Unlike the rest of the MMBN series, <a href=\"/rockman-exe-ws/3030-24887/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24887\"> Rockman EXE WS</a> aside, Network Transmission is a 2D platformer akin to the <a href=\"/mega-man-classic/3025-626/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-626\"> Classic Mega Man</a> games. However, it incorporates many of Battle Network's elements, including Battle Chips, Sub chips, and MegaBuster Power-Ups.</p><p>The game is an <a href=\"/interquel/3015-3413/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3413\"> interquel</a>, taking place between the first and second Battle Network games. It features Japanese voice acting, which is unfortunately left intact in the game's international releases.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In Network Transmission, players take control of <a href=\"/megamanexe/3005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1456\"> Mega Man.EXE</a>. Mega Man, with the help of his Operator <a href=\"/lan-hikari/3005-3403/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3403\"> Lan Hikari</a>, must navigate \"Cyberworld\" while fending off Viruses and defeating malicious <a href=\"/netnavi/3015-2546/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2546\"> Net Navis</a>. Unlike the Battle Network RPGs, the player never takes direct control of Lan; in fact, the \"real world\" is only used to save the game, access <a href=\"/higsby/3005-8787/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8787\"> Higsby's</a> store, and select the stage that Mega Man will enter.</p><h3>Basic Actions</h3><p>Like Classic Mega Man, Mega Man.EXE can run, jump, slide, fire his MegaBuster arm cannon and, after a certain power-up, charge the Buster to create a stronger shot. The amount of punishment that Mega Man can take is determined by his HP, which can be restored with health pick-ups and extended with HP Memory power-ups. Mega Man is destroyed if he has no HP, falls through the bottom of the stage, or touches a massively-damaging obstacle (like spikes or lava). Mega Man will be permanently deleted if he is destroyed with no \"Backups\" remaining, and the player will lose any unsaved progress.</p><h3>Battle Chips</h3><p>Although the MegaBuster is Mega Man's trademark weapon, it is much weaker in Network Transmission and, in its initial state, requires <em>dozens</em> of shots to defeat a virus. However, Battle Chips are much more powerful. These card-like weapons allow Mega Man to access a variety of weapons, barriers and other miscellaneous powers. Lan can carry twenty unique chips at a time in his Folder. Extra Battle Chips are randomly dropped from viruses, and can also be bought at Higsby's store.</p><p>As soon as the stage starts (or whenever Mega Man is rebooted from a deletion), the Custom Screen appears. This allows the player to choose up to five Battle Chips to send to Mega Man. Once Mega Man has received the chip data, the player must wait for the Custom Gauge (located at the top of the screen) to refill before he or she can reopen the Custom Screen. If the player does not load Mega Man with five chips, they will gain extra Battle Chips to choose from upon reopening the Custom Menu. (For example, if three out of five chips are loaded, the number of Battle Chips available on the Custom Menu expands by two.)</p><p>Technically, activating a Battle Chip uses it up; however, unlike the original Battle Network games, spare copies of a Battle Chip essentially serve as ammo. Therefore, if the player has collected twenty \"Cannon\" chips, Cannon can be used twenty times before it becomes unavailable. Each Battle Chip has a unique duplicate limit.</p><p>Battle Chips are further balanced by Memory Points. The MP Gauge appears next to MegaMan's HP and essentially functions like the Classic games' Weapon Gauge. Each Battle Chip has its own MB rating, which is subtracted from Mega Man's MP when used. The MP Gauge slowly regenerates over time, but heavy usage of powerful attacks will force the player to wait until Mega Man has freed up enough memory to use another chip.</p><h3>Power-UP</h3><p>Power-UPs boost the capabilities of Mega Man's Buster. There are three categories, Power, Rapid, and Charge. Power increases the damage of Buster shots, Rapid decreases the wait time between shots, and Charge first enables Charge Shots, then improves their potency and charge time.</p><h3>Armor</h3><p>The Armor system also returns from the first Battle Network. Fire, Aqua, Elec, and Wood Armor decrease the damage that Mega Man takes from attacks that aren't of their weakness. (Aqua douses Fire, Elec electrocutes Aqua, Wood grounds out Elec, Fire burns Wood)</p>", "deck": "Mega Man Network Transmission combines elements of Mega Man's traditional platforming and Battle Network's card-based fighting.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1806094-box_mmnt.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1806094-box_mmnt.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-network-transmission/3030-6358/", "name": "Mega Man Network Transmission", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-6358/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/", "abbreviation": "GCN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/", "id": 23, "name": "GameCube"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:57:19", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 6358, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "Rockman EXE Transmission"}, "platform": "GameCube", "title": "Mega Man Network Transmission"}, {"duration": "0:40:00", "runner": "Domalix, Calebhart42, CrystalUnclear, Walrus_prime", "data": {"original_release_date": "1993-12-17 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2016-08-11 01:16:07", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2586377\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2586377-mmx_jpbox.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1316964285714\" data-width=\"448\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 448px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2586377-mmx_jpbox.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2586377\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2586377-mmx_jpbox.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2586377-mmx_jpbox.png 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" data-width=\"565\"></a></figure><p>Mega Man X (known in Japan as Rockman X) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> for the Super Famicom in December 1993 and on the US <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> on January 1994.</p><p>The spiritual successor to the classic <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man/3025-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a> platformers (for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>), Mega Man X reinvents the series by introducing players to a faster, more technologically adept hero (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x/3005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1474\">Mega Man X</a>, known simply as \"X\") set in a brand new (and darker) storyline (which is further expanded by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x/3025-524/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-524\">numerous sequels</a>).</p><p>Set in the year 21XX, a century after the adventures of the original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man/3005-344/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-344\">Mega Man</a>, players control Mega Man X, a highly-advanced <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/android/3015-692/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-692\">android</a> (with the unprecedented ability to think as a human) developed by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dr-light/3005-292/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-292\">Dr. Light</a> and incubated in a large <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/capsule/3055-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-402\">capsule</a> for a 100-year diagnostic program (to help X understand sanity and morality).

Despite these additions, the game uses the same progression, as players guide the hero through each themed level (in any order), led by a boss that grants a new weapon when defeated (and is weak by a specific other weapon), before infiltrating the major antagonist's fortress.</p><p>Mega Man X later received a port to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> (in 1995), <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> (via <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii Virtual Console</a> on April 18, 2011), all iOS devices (on December 21, 2011), and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> (via <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii U Virtual Console</a> on May 30, 2013).

It was also the only game to support Microsoft's Tray and Play feature, in which players can start playing the campaign while the game is installing. This version also includes two exclusive multiplayer maps (along with most of the DLC maps) and an official map editor.

Under the new system, once <a href=\"/shield-regeneration/3015-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">shields</a> have been depleted, the player can only take a few hits until death, but once shields recharge, health resets. This is explained through the new Mark VI suit, which injects bio-foam directly into the wearer's wounds. <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Active Camo</a> has been removed as an item. Instead, the Arbiter has a rechargeable version of Camo, instead of a <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlight</a> like the Chief. Another new addition is <a href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wielding</a> certain weapons, including the <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, the new <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">SMG</a>, the <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">needler</a>, the <a href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\">plasma pistol</a>, and the <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">plasma rifle</a>. When dual wielding, weapons take longer to reload and the ability to throw <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades</a> is taken out. Another newly added mechanic is the ability to board enemy vehicles when they are near the player and travelling at low speeds.</p><p>The most noticeable change in the weapons is the absence of the iconic <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>. It is replaced by the new <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">battle rifle</a>; a three shot burst weapon with a 2x scope. The Covenant equivalent of the battle rifle is the <a href=\"/covenant-carbine/3055-137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-137\">carbine</a>; a semi-automatic weapon that also has a 2x scope (the carbine uses <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammo</a> instead of battery power). In addition to the battle rifle and carbine, there is now the SMG (a small compact fully automatic weapon), a new pistol with no scope, the <a href=\"/brute-shot/3055-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">brute shot</a> (Covenant <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>), a <a href=\"/brute-plasma-rifle/3055-1105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1105\">brute plasma rifle</a> (which fires faster than the regular plasma rifle), an improved <a href=\"/m41-rocket-launcher/3055-134/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">rocket launcher</a> (which locks onto enemy vehicles), and the <a href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">energy sword</a> (which can now be used by the player).</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Compared to Halo: Combat Evolved, there have been some noticeable changes in the arsenals of both Human and Covenant forces. The <a href=\"/ma5b-assault-rifle/3055-5594/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5594\">MA5-series Assault Rifle</a> has been absent, replaced by both the <a href=\"/m7-smg/3055-126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 Submachine Gun</a> and <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">BR55 Battle Rifle</a>. The <a href=\"/m6d-pistol/3055-2806/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2806\">M6D Magnum</a> has also been replaced by the weaker M6C Magnum. The Covenant now have new tools in their disposal: the semi-automatic Covenant Carbine, the long-ranged Particle Beam Rifle, the Brute Plasma Rifle, and the explosive Brute Shot. Players can now carry the Fuel Rod Gun and Energy Sword into combat, as well as equip the mysterious Sentinel Beam.</p><h4>Human Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/m6c-magnum/3055-2807/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\"><b>Magnum</b></a> - A semi-automatic <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">handgun</a> useful for short-to-medium ranged combat.

The game had many advanced features including <a href=\"/matchmaking/3015-3334/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3334\">matchmaking</a>, <a href=\"/voice-chat/3015-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-648\">voice chat</a>, and <a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">rankings</a>. There was also some customization implemented into the game as well, which created a lot of <a href=\"/user-generated-content/3015-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">user created content</a>. Many games came out of these customization options, such as Tremors, Troy, Vehicle Wars and the most popular being <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">Zombies</a> which grew so popular Bungie saw fit to put it into Halo 3. Players really enjoyed the customization options and kept many players sticking around even after getting their fill of matchmaking. The match making games were very competitive in Halo 2 due to the intensive ranking system. The way the ranking system in Halo 2 works is when the player first starts playing the game they start at level 1 and as they win matches their level increases. If they lose enough matches they can drop levels. These ranking were taken very seriously by the Halo 2 community. The color of the level a player had was very important to most Halo 2 fanatics. They can see what the levels look like in the picture below.</p><p>Levels 44-50 were \"secret\" levels -- they were picture of various things, such as the moon or the halo ring.</p><p>Halo 2 had 24 maps the people could play online and was the most played game ever on Xbox Live. Even after the Xbox 360 was released Halo 2 still remained the most popular. The first game to top the amount of online players Halo 2 had each month, was the original <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War</a>.</p><h3>Cla<b>n</b></h3><p>Halo 2 is one of the few Xbox games ever that supported \"clans\", which are basically a group or team of players that play games against other \"clans\". This was a huge part of Halo 2 and was very successful. Clans on console games have never really worked that well and Halo 2 introduced a quick, and easy, way to make them without having the dedication PC clan members have. To check out their clan the player can press the Y button and bring up the friends list, they can scroll right, which will bring them to the clan page. If they are not in a clan, they can join a clan (if they were invited to a clan). They must receive a \"clan invite\" to be able to join a clan. If they have not been invited to a clan, they can create their own clan. If they decide to go down this route, they will be asked to create a unique name for their clan. This name can not be changed and must be appropriate, or Bungie will reject the name. After creating a name, they must invite people to join the clan. Players are only allowed to be in one clan at one time. When members join, they will first be at the level of member, but the Overlords of the clan are allowed to change their status.</p><h3>Clan Status Levels</h3><ol><li><u>Overlord</u>- The creator of the clan is the Overlord and has complete control over the clan. The Overlord can elect other trustworthy clan members to also be an Overlord.</li><li><u>Staff</u>- Staff members are important respected members of a clan. Their level of power can vary by the amount of power the Overlord gives Staff members.</li><li><u>Membe</u>r- When someone joins a clan, they are a Member. This is the middle class in a clan. Most clan members are Members. Members do not hold much power.</li><li><u>Peon</u>- The level of Peon is the lowest level of status. Peons hold no power.</li></ol><h3>Matchmaking Playlists</h3><ul><li>Rumble Pit</li><li>Double Team</li><li>Team Slayer</li><li>Team Skirmish</li><li>Team Training</li><li>Team Snipers</li><li>Team Hardcore</li><li>Big Team Battle</li><li>Team SWAT</li><li>H2 Challenge</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer Maps</h2><p>The Xbox version of Halo 2 included 12 multiplayer maps.

The disc is also backwards-compatible with the Xbox 360 and is the only current way to download the Bonus, Killtacular, and Maptacular map packs. (Unless the Windows Vista version is being played.)</p><h2>Multiplayer Glitches</h2><p>Several weeks and months after Halo 2's release, players began to discover and take advantage of several relatively major glitches in the game. As players began to practice these glitches and become well-versed in executing them they gained a much more significant place in the <a href=\"/meta-game/3015-905/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-905\">meta-game</a>, with some of the weapon-based glitches becoming essential for success against the higher ranking players. While game creator Bungie officially decreed on several occasions that a player's use of glitches for personal gain, in a Matchmaking setting, was a form of cheating, the developer had no way of tracking the use of such glitches by players. Ultimately, there were no widespread punishments or repercussions handed-down to players who utilized these glitches.</p><p>Some of the most noteworthy glitches:</p><h3><a href=\"/bxr/3015-2751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2751\"><b>BXR</b></a></h3><p>Commonly used in conjunction with the <a href=\"/br55-battle-rifle/3055-132/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">Battle Rifle</a> (though possible to execute with any reloadable weapon) the BXR was a weapon animation glitch that allowed for a nearly instantaneous close-ranged kill. The glitch became very widespread among the highest ranks of players as the meta-game progressed.</p><h3>Quick Reload (YY)</h3><p>Another glitch commonly used among higher-caliber players, the Quick Reload glitch was a weapon animation glitch that shaved precious seconds off of a player's reload time, allowing them to fire their weapon again sooner than they normally would with the default reload. The glitch was only possible when a player was carrying a secondary weapon. The move was executed by the player pressing the Y button twice in quick succession as soon as the reload animation reached the point where the in-game character began to insert a new clip into the weapon. If done properly the player will quickly switch to their secondary weapon and then back to their primary, eliminating the rest of the reload animation while still giving the player a full clip.</p><h3>Double Melee (BXB)</h3><p>A third weapon animation glitch, the BXB was used to give players a significant advantage in close-range combat. Executed by pressing B, X, B in quick succession (under the default controller settings), the glitch allowed players to melee twice in a much shorter time span than if they were simply to press the melee button two times. Contrary to the BXR, which required a full clip of ammo to execute properly, the BXB required the player to have a partially depleted or empty ammo clip in their primary weapon. As with the other weapon glitches, the BXB saw very widespread use among the top-tier players.</p><h3>Double Shot (RRX)</h3><p>One of the most popular glitches among <a href=\"/major-league-gaming/3015-1858/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG</a> fans and players, the Double Shot was a glitch that was used primarily with the Battle Rifle that allowed players to fire two of the weapon's 3-shot bursts in one shot, resulting in 6 bullets being fired at once. The downside to this glitch was that after successfully firing a Double Shot, there was a significant span of time (roughly two to three seconds) where the player could not fire their weapon, and could only attack if they threw a grenade, used a melee attack, or switched to a secondary weapon. For this reason players would often hold off on using a Double Shot unless they were one or several \"shots down\" in a BR fight, or had a secondary weapon that they could \"YY\" with to cancel the long delay after a successful double shot.</p><h3>Quad Shot (RRXYYRRX)</h3><p>Similar to the double shot the quad shot, if done right, can shoot 4 shots out of the BR in half the time it normally would take. To do this the player need two weapons, first they start out with their double shot then they press \"YY\" really fast in order to cancel the reload; if they double shot correctly they will notice the reload animation isn't playing but it is still reloading in the background (this is normal so don't worry), now after pressing \"YY\" do another double shot, and with much practice the player can do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCEZz1zS3aQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-bouncing/3015-401/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-401\">Super Bouncing</a> (also known as Super Jumping)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.7421875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\"><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/908232-superbounce1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A first-person view from a player who \"></noscript></a><figcaption>A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.</figcaption></figure><p>A glitch in the game's <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok</a> physics engine that makes it possible for players to \"bounce\" to extreme heights, enabling them to reach previously inaccessible and out-of-bounds regions on a multiplayer map. The glitch was used quite frequently in a Matchmaking setting to give a player or team a significant advantage through an unreachable hiding spot or unfair vantage point.</p><h3>Sword Canceling (Butterflying)</h3><p>Sword canceling is a glitch that takes advantage of the \"lunge\" effect that the Energy Sword provides for the player. By aiming at an opponent with the Energy Sword at a close enough proximity for the reticule to light up red, then pressing the Right Trigger and X in quick succession, a player can achieve the normal Sword lunge without in any way damaging their opponent. The glitch is most commonly used to give players a means of reaching previously inaccessible ledges or areas of a map. The glitch earned the nickname \"Butterflying\" due to the strange, butterfly-like motion of the character model's arms when performing the sword cancel.</p><h3>Rocket Sword Glitch</h3><p>A glitch that would require a sword and a rocket launcher as a secondary. The player would look at an enemy from a distance and rapidly alternate pressing \"Y\" and \"B\" and they would launch towards the person they were aiming at from afar.</p><h2>Cheating</h2><p>As with most online games, Halo 2's online environment featured some players who manipulated and modified certain aspects of the game to provide themselves with an unfair advantage over their opponents. Players cheated most commonly in matchmaking playlists, so that they could more easily obtain a matchmaking rank that players would see associated with their gamertag. The highest-level matchmaking ranks, that featured symbols in place of numbers (ranks 44-50), were the most desirable and most sought after ranks to cheaters; therefore, non-cheaters often found it very difficult to play a legitimate, cheat-free match at the highest ranks. There were several different methods of cheating, each with different effects on gameplay.</p><h3>Modding</h3><p>Achieved through the use of cheat-devices such as Action Replay, Modding was the most common, game-changing form of cheating. \"Modders\" manipulated map files and gametypes to create gameplay that was well-outside the normal limits placed by the game engine. Common modded elements were changes in player speed and gravity, changed weapon properties (such as <a href=\"/plasma-rifle/3055-122/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifles</a> that fired <a href=\"/wraith/3055-531/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\">Wraith</a> projectiles), and changed vehicle properties (flying <a href=\"/m12-warthog/3055-193/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-193\">Warthogs</a>, flying turrets, faster <a href=\"/scorpion/3055-760/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-760\">Scorpions</a>, etc.). Due to the dramatic, game-changing effects of modding, it was fairly easy for Bungie's automated banning tool -- notoriously dubbed the \"Banhammer\" by players and Bungie staff -- to detect and ban players who used modded files in matchmade games. Most \"modders\" had only a few hours, at most, to rise through the matchmaking ranks before being faced with a permanent ban, and a vast majority of modders were inevitably banned. The problem was that there were so many free two-month Xbox Live trials available, it was easy for a modder to quickly make another account.</p><h3>Standbying</h3><p>The second most game-changing form of cheating, behind Modding, was known as Standbying. Making use of the game's host-based server system, standbying was achieved by having the \"host\" player manipulate their internet connection to cause problems for the other players in the match. When the host managed to successfully tamper with their connection, it would cause all of the other players in the game to experience enormous amounts of lag. The host's Xbox was immune to the lag issues, and could travel around the map killing enemy players or completing game objectives without much, if any, opposition. Though the Standby glitch was originally achieved by players manually pressing the \"Standby\" button on their router, modem, or switch, eventually players used various computer software so that they could throttle the connections of only the opposing team, giving all of their teammates a reprieve from the negative effects of the glitch. Eventually, Bungie improved the banhammer to better detect and control \"standbyers\" in matchmaking.</p><h3>Bridging</h3><p>Bridging was a method of controlling \"host\" in a matchmaking game, and, more specifically, a way of ensuring that a certain player in the game always received host. Unlike modding and standbying, though, bridging was not a very detrimental form of cheating on its own. Bridging was accomplished through the use of specific Firewall software that controlled the ports and incoming IP Addresses for a player's router or switch. By using the program with the correct settings, a player could be ensured of being host for every game they played. Also, due to the nature of the glitch, bridgers could not be matched with or against other bridgers, so the bridging player always decided who received host. While Bridging was used in conjunction with Standbying or Modding to ensure that those forms of cheating worked as efficiently as possible by giving a certain player host, it was also used as a preventative measure against cheaters. Some players used bridging to make sure that no nefarious players could obtain host, therefore ensuring a quality match experience. As of the 1.6 update for Halo 2, the most common methods of Bridging were no longer effective or possible in matchmaking.</p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><p>The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack was released in two volumes, composed by <a href=\"/martin-odonnell/3040-1741/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1741\">Martin O'Donnel</a> and <a href=\"/michael-salvatori/3040-1742/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1742\">Michael Salvatori</a>.

Along with all the downloadable content, this version features unique controller-based features, as well as a special \"armored suit\" that grants Batman and Catwoman some perks.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Batman: Arkham City is set one year after the events of Arkham Asylum. After taking credit for the take down of <a href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-952\">the Joker</a>, Quincy Sharp has managed to become the new <a href=\"/mayor/3015-5846/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5846\">mayor</a> of <a href=\"../../gotham-city/95-111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City</a>. Despite knowing that Sharp was dangerously psychotic from reading his journal in the first game, Batman did nothing to prevent this. Due to the fact that <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\">Arkham Asylum</a> and <a href=\"/blackgate-penitentiary/3035-2426/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2426\">Blackgate Prison</a> are both unfit to store prisoners, Sharp has the slums of Gotham walled off in order to create a new \"prison\" for the inmates, nicknamed \" <a href=\"/arkham-city/3035-3613/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3613\">Arkham City</a>\". With the walls in place, Sharp lets the inmates loose with one simple rule: not to try and escape. Psychologist <a href=\"/hugo-strange/3005-16295/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16295\">Hugo Strange</a> is brought in as the 'warden' of this new prison.</p><p>Sharp secretly hopes that by placing all the dangerous Gotham criminals into an isolated part of the city, they will simply all kill each other, thus getting rid of the criminal problem in Gotham. However, the criminals quickly form into different gangs, all led by Batman's toughest enemies. One is lead by the Joker, with <a href=\"///\">Harley Quinn</a> at his side. <a href=\"/two-face/3005-4995/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4995\">Two-Face</a> also leads a gang, but since he was only recently placed in the facility, he has to prove his worth to build up a powerful gang. He plans to do this by killing <a href=\"../../catwoman/94-654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catwoman</a>. The third major gang belongs to <a href=\"/the-penguin/3005-5818/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5818\">the Penguin</a>, who has somehow manged to arm his minions with cutting-edge military technology.</p><p>The game begins with the player playing as Bruce Wayne, who has taken a sudden interest in politics, and is trying to get Arkham City closed down. During a press conference, Strange's men (a mercenary strike team called TYGER) interfere and capture Bruce. Batman's alter-ego wakes up strapped to a chair, as Strange reveals that he knows Bruce is Batman, and that soon everything will end when he unleashes \"Protocol 10\". Bruce is set free in Arkham City, briefly tangles with the Penguin's men, and climbs a building in order to get a signal to his allies. Bruce orders Alfred to send him his suit via the Batwing, and Bruce Wayne gives way to Batman.</p><p>Batman hears that Catwoman is being held by Two-Face in the courthouse. Determined to find out what Protocol 10 is, the Caped Crusader decides to go and save Selina in hopes that she'll know more about what's going on. After saving the cat and barely avoiding an assassination attempt from the Joker, Batman decides to go and pay the Joker a visit at his base in the steel mill. The Joker is deathly ill, suffering the aftereffects of the massive dose of Titan he injected himself with at the end of the first game, and his gang is controlled for the most part by Harley Quinn. Upon arriving at Joker's location, Joker fakes his death with a double and captures Batman. The Bat wakes up tied to a wheelchair, with an IV in his arm administering Joker's contaminated blood to him. The Joker explains that he will be dead in a matter of hours and now, so will Batman. There is no cure to his sickness, as all the doctors the psycho brought in have failed to cure him. <a href=\"/mr-freeze/3005-5866/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5866\">Mister Freeze</a> was developing a cure before he was kidnapped by the Penguin. Furthermore, the Joker has anonymously donated his poisoned blood to every hospital in Gotham City, so that even if he dies, he'll have the last laugh. Batman now only has a couple of hours to find a cure before he, and the innocent people who receive the Joker's blood, die. As a token of his gratitude for his \"help\", the Joker pushes Batman's wheelchair out a five story window, almost killing him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1873622\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1873622\"><img alt=\"The Penguin\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg 1000w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134083/1873622-penguincloseup.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Penguin</figcaption></figure><p>Batman succeeds in stopping the Penguin and rescuing Freeze, who reveals that he is nowhere close to a cure. Batman figures out that a cure could be fabricated by using <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/3005-10163/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10163\">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s blood. Batman tracks down al Ghul's hideout with a little help from Robin and reunites with <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/3005-13248/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13248\">Talia al Ghul</a>, his daughter, who loves Batman and knows his secret identity. The only problem is that Batman is sick, very sick. He's so sick that at one point, Oracle asks him what his will to <a href=\"/robin/3005-3822/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3822\">Robin</a> should be, how should he carry on the flame. He even passes out and sees \"The Light\" and his parents, beckoning him to come and join them. He eventually makes it to Ra's' hideout, and has no choice but to accept the trials to become the master of the League of Shadows, as it allows him to drink a mysterious potion called the Demon's Blood, which gives him his strength back, but will only delay the onset of his symptoms by a matter of hours. Batman passes all the trials but refuses to kill Ra's and replace him as the new master of the League. He still succeeds in getting the master's blood and heads back to Freeze, who creates an antidote but betrays the Caped Crusader, hoping to use the antidote as leverage to force Batman to rescue Freeze's wife Nora, still in her cryogenic chamber, who has been 'kidnapped' by the Joker's men. They do battle, and Batman wins, but the antidote was stolen by Harley Quinn during the fight.</p><p>Now genuinely pissed off, Batman goes back to the steel mill to get the cure from a much-healthier looking Joker. Just as the Dark Knight is about to defeat the Clown Prince of Crime, Strange initiates Protocol 10, which is in fact the mass extermination of all prisoners in Arkham City, in order to make the world a better place. Batman is crushed by rubble and is about to get his face ripped off by the Joker when Talia suddenly appears and offers the Joker immortality via her father's Lazarus Pit. Talia takes the Joker away while triggering a homing beacon previously planted on one of her ninjas, so Batman will be able to find her again. Batman is saved by Catwoman, and wants to go after Talia, but Alfred blocks his access to the WayneTech tracking satellites, claiming that Bruce mustn't let emotions get in the way, that Batman was destined to save the world and that this is what he must do.</p><p>With no other choice, Batman goes after Strange, who gloats to his men that soon, facilities like Arkham City will be constructed in other major cities like <a href=\"/metropolis/3035-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-114\">Metropolis</a> and Keystone City. It's revealed that Strange is but a puppet, and has been working for Ra's al Ghul all along, sharing his vision of violently ridding the world of criminal scum. For failing to defeat Batman, Ra's murders Strange, who then triggers Protocol 11, a safeguard which even al Ghul didn't know about - which causes his tower headquarters to violently explode. Batman and al Ghul jump out but Ra's commits suicide with his own sword in the air in an attempt to take Batman with him, which fails. With Protocol 10 stopped, Batman goes to save Talia, who is being held by Joker in a movie theatre. The Joker holds Talia at gunpoint, but she manages to escape her captor and kill the Joker by impaling him with her sword. Batman reprimands Talia for killing the clown right before Talia is shot in the back and killed by... the Joker. It's revealed that the Joker is still very much alive, and very much sick, inches away from dying (much like Batman). The Joker lying dead on the floor isn't actually the Joker, or dead; the healthy Joker Batman has been dealing with since the theft of the cure was <a href=\"/clayface/3005-5776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5776\">Clayface</a> all along. It turns out that although Harley stole the cure from Mister Freeze, Talia went and stole it right back before it could be administered to the Joker.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868514\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2798634812287\" data-width=\"1172\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1172px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868514\"><img alt=\"The last joke?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 1172w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 750w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The last joke?\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 1172w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 750w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868514-08_joker_sick_laugh_sm_304.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The last joke?</figcaption></figure><p>Batman is forced to fight Clayface, and eventually defeats him thanks to the ice grenades he was given by Mister Freeze, and obtains the cure. Batman drinks half of the cure, becoming healthy again, as the Joker laughs his head off at Talia's death. The Clown Prince of Crime explains that despite the fact that the Joker has created so much mayhem and has killed the one woman who has ever loved Batman, the Dark Knight is still forced to save him as that is his rule of conduct. As Batman debates whether or not to save him, the Joker attacks him, causing the hero to drop the cure which breaks on the ground. Batman looks on as the Joker tries to save the cure, and states that despite all the mayhem, he would've saved him. Shocked, the Joker dies with a smile on his face. Batman walks the Joker's corpse out of Arkham City and leaves it on a police car. <a href=\"/james-gordon/3005-6404/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6404\">Commissioner Gordon</a> arrives, asking Batman \"What the hell happened in there?\". The Caped Crusader ignores the question and just walks away.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p>If players go back to the steel mill, where Joker's base of operations were set up, they'll see Harley Quinn's original uniform. By the uniform is a pregnancy test. The pregnancy test shows positive (+). In the finale of the credits, players can hear Harley Quinn singing a lullaby. The song goes, \"hush little baby don't say a word, momma's gonna kill for you the whole damn world.\" This was originally interpreted by fans to mean as a hint towards a potential plot point in a sequel with Harley carrying the Joker's child. However, the follow-up story DLC Harley Quinn's Revenge puts this possibility to rest as it shows that the original pregnancy test was actually a false positive and that Harley was not in fact pregnant. </p><h3>Catwoman</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799980\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799980\"><img alt=\"What are Catwoman's true motives?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"What are Catwoman's true motives?\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/110502/1799980-1839747_0_catwoman_risky_super.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></noscript></a><figcaption>What are Catwoman's true motives?</figcaption></figure><p>Catwoman, Selina Kyle, has a different storyline than Batman's that takes place over four episodes. Catwoman starts the game while trying to steal a microchip from Two-Face, who captures her and dangles her over a vat of acid. She's saved by Batman, and further damages Two-Face's face. After leaving Batman's company she resolves to steal the valuables Dr. Strange has seized from Arkham's prisoners. Catwoman asks Poison Ivy for help, and after fighting some of her goons, she is convinced to creates a hole allowing Catwoman to get inside the vault.</p><p>After defeating several guards she leaves the vault only to be confronted by a picture of Batman trapped underneath some rubble. There are two possible endings to the situation. One is that she has a sudden change of heart and decides to go to Batman's aid. The other is that she abandons Batman to his fate, and the game ends. After a while the credits will rewind and give the player the opportunity to make the \"right\" choice. After saving Batman, Catwomen goes back to her apartment to get the rest of the loot that she stole from Strange before escaping from Arkham. Only to discover that Two-Face has stolen all of it. Selina tracks Dent down but realizes that he's sold half of the loot already. Catwoman's role ends with her searching for her missing loot.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Arkham City's gameplay is similar to its predecessor with some added touches. Batman's movements default to a walk. Holding down the run button will make Batman run and jump over certain obstacles. Pressing the run button twice will make Batman roll.</p><p>Movement in Arkham City isn't just limited to running around. Batman has his trusty grappling hook and cape to help him fly around. Batman can use his grappling hook to shoot himself up to ledges, and the grapnel boost upgrade propels him above ledges where he can use his cape to glide. Batman can now dive bomb while gliding. This can be used to take out enemies, solve puzzles or glide some more. Batman can also wall jump to keep on gliding in tight spaces.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811248\"><img alt=\"Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1811248-051_silent_takedown_90.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stealth is a major component of Arkham City.</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in Arkham City is a mix of one button combos and counters. Batman kicks and punches with the press of one button. As he racks up a combo, his moves become quicker and more aggressive. Batman can also counter enemy attacks. He can counter up to 3 attacks at once. Finally, if an enemy is knocked down, Batman can finish them off. Chaining attacks makes the multiplier go up. Once the player has reached x10, he can unleash a devastating attack (Batman calls in bats that stun all surrounding enemies; Batman jumps into the air, throwing Batarangs at all enemies on the ground, finishing them off). Some of these attacks will stop the multiplier while getting hit by an attack will set the combo multiplier back to zero. Arkham City adds critical strikes where if the player times his strikes correctly, he can inflict a critical blow on his foes. Batman can also use stealth, hiding on top of gargoyles or in vents, silently taking down enemies (there are also smack-downs during these stealth takedowns where players can quicken the takedown but risk alerting nearby guards).</p><p>Detective Vision lets Batman see weak structures, hidden fuse boxes and power lines. It's also very useful during stealth as it tells the player how many enemies there are in the area, how many are armed and what their state of mind is. Detective mode can also be used to solve Riddler Challenges.

They did this through the expansion of Batman's moves, gadgets, and abilities. With the addition of all the new elements the number of animations in the game double from the previous one.</p><p>Another key difference in this game is the addition of an <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a> for Batman to navigate. The game world is five times larger than the secluded island Arkham Asylum was set on and around. To offset the increase in game size, Rocksteady added more side missions and challenges for the player to take on, while still steering players to the main path storyline. With Batman gaining the ability to dive and maintain forward momentum while gliding, players will be able to navigate Arkham City more quickly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868518\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62077922077922\" data-width=\"1155\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1155px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868518\"><img alt=\"Joker Propaganda\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 1155w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Joker Propaganda\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 1155w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1868518-arkham_poster_new_01b_120.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Joker Propaganda</figcaption></figure><p>Each section of the city that is controlled by a villain will have its own unique characteristics based upon that villain.

data-ref-id=\"3010-1479\">Cinematronics</a>, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator <a href=\"/don-bluth/3040-45789/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45789\">Don Bluth</a>. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as <a href=\"/space-ace/3030-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-463\">Space Ace</a>, <a href=\"/begas-battle/3030-36549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36549\">Bega's Battle</a>, and <a href=\"/cliff-hanger/3030-18849/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18849\">Cliff Hanger</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462473\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6765625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462473\"><img alt=\"Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6763/462473-s_dragonslair_5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the \"<a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a>\" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different \"chapters\" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a>, featured in games like <a href=\"/shenmue/3030-7812/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue</a>, <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>, and <a href=\"/heavy-rain/3030-21304/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21304\">Heavy Rain</a>.</p><p>In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played \"in reverse\" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.</p><p>An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last \"life\" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Dragon\u2019s Lair was the brain child of <a href=\"/rick-dyer/3040-47901/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47901\">Rick Dyer</a>, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic \u201cAdventure\u201d was another inspiration for Dragon\u2019s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn\u2019t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic\u2019s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.</p><h2>Xbox Live Arcade Port</h2><p>On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>. The port is developed by <a href=\"/digital-leisure-inc/3010-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-50\">Digital Leisure</a> and published by <a href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft Studios</a>.

Left 4 Dead was released on November 18th, 2008 in North America and worldwide through <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"/steam/3015-718/\"> Steam</a> on both the PC and Xbox 360. The game pits four human survivors of a zombie apocalypse against hordes of the undead as they attempt to reach safety or evacuation in Campaign mode, and in Versus another four players as the undead.</p><p>The original concept for Left 4 Dead was based on a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11663\" href=\"/half-life-counter-strike/3030-11663/\"> Counter-Strike</a> mod called Terror Strike. This gameplay featured a small group of counter terrorists armed with weapons fighting off hordes of knife wielding terrorists. The team wanted to make a full experience out of this mod, and the zombie apocalypse was a perfect fit.</p><h2>Pre-Order Bonus and Demo</h2><p>On Thursday November 6th, 2008 early access was granted to the Left 4 Dead demo for people who pre-ordered the game for the Xbox 360 console and Windows PC. The console version of the demo was released a few hours earlier than the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\"> PC</a> version. The demo features both online co-op and a single-player experience of two levels within one of the game's chapters.</p><p>As well as early access to the demo the game had a 10% reduction in price for people who wished to pre-order the game. This applied to the version of Left 4 Dead being release through <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"/steam/3015-718/\"> Steam</a> for PC players or retail outlets such as GameStop and EB Games for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\"> Xbox 360</a> players. There has however been some controversy regarding the pre-orders for the game from GameStop where pre-order codes were not issued in time for the early release of the demo, as well as the fact people could sign up to the GameStop website and receive a pre-order code for the demo even if they did not actually pre-order the game itself.</p><p>For those who did not pre-order the game the demo was made available on November 11th, 2008 for both the PC and Xbox 360. After the game's release the demo was taken off the Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>According to Shacknews, Left 4 Dead's preorders surpassed those of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17729\" href=\"/the-orange-box/3030-17729/\"> The Orange Box</a> by around 95%.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Campaign</h3><p>Each scenario, or \"movie,\" is divided into five sub-scenarios, showcasing a desperate push from one safe house to another, fighting off hordes of ferocious Infected. In the first sub-scenario, for example, the survivors must make their way to the streets below and into the subway system where there is a safehouse, where they may recuperate and re-arm before making their way to the next safehouse. Each campaign ends with what's called a \"finale\", where the players must hold out against hundreds of charging Infected while awaiting rescue. Players have unlimited time to gather up supplies and figure out a plan before starting the finale, which is done by contacting the rescue vehicle through a radio.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4102/851094-764e7f16c7b77bc188873549ec127479300cab8b_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851094\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4102/851094-764e7f16c7b77bc188873549ec127479300cab8b_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851094\"><img alt=\"Zoey\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4102/851094-764e7f16c7b77bc188873549ec127479300cab8b_full.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4102/851094-764e7f16c7b77bc188873549ec127479300cab8b_full.jpg 184w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" data-width=\"184\"></a><figcaption>Zoey</figcaption></figure><p>There are four difficulties to choose from: Easy, Normal, Advanced and Expert.

In this mode human controlled players can play as advanced zombie mutations, known as Special Infected, which come in four types: \u201c <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7313\" href=\"/the-boomer/3005-7313/\"> Boomers</a>\u201d, \u201c <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8538\" href=\"/the-hunter/3005-8538/\"> Hunters</a>\u201d, \u201c <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8537\" href=\"/the-smoker/3005-8537/\"> Smokers</a>\u201d, or \u201c <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8535\" href=\"/the-tank/3005-8535/\"> Tanks</a>\u201d; the latter of which will spawn only a few times during a game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/803840-937407_20081027_screen003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-803840\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.53805073431242\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/803840-937407_20081027_screen003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-803840\"><img alt=\"The main characters.

The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-329\" href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\"> DLC</a> is free of charge and comes with the two campaigns that were missing in Versus mode. Survival mode is played in one of sixteen levels available, fifteen of which are taken from the current campaigns, and includes one new level called The Last Stand, which features a lighthouse. No enemies will appear before the players start the event and they have as much time as they want to set up, mostly consisting of placing gas cans and other explosives around the map. They need to work together to survive against waves of zombie attacks by making organized runs for ammo and fighting off the horde as well as Special Infected for as long as possible; it is said that rounds will rarely last up to 9 minutes because of continual increase in difficulty as the round goes on. The longer the survivors are alive the more frequently they will be attacked by the special infected. The goal of Survival mode is to survive as long as possible and you get a bronze, silver or gold medal at the 4, 7 and 10 minutes mark.</p><p>Survival comes with world leaderboards although they are next to useless as many players have found ways to exploit glitches and get to the top positions with thousands and thousands of minutes survived.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>The Basics</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965657\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.8\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965657\"><img alt=\"Load screen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Load screen\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/965657-untitled12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Load screen</figcaption></figure><p>Players must work together to fight off numerous zombie attacks in order to reach a safe room or an escape vehicle. In addition to the standard zombies, advanced mutations occasionally appear, each causing their own type of havoc. The \"Boomer\" type of Infected will vomit on players, which causes the player's vision to become a green haze while attracting other zombies. The \"Hunter\" type will pin down a player, making it necessary for the other teammates to come to their rescue by shooting or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-444\" href=\"/melee/3015-444/\"> shoving</a> the zombie off of them (shooting a survivor being attacked by a Hunter or Smoker does no damage to them). The \"Smoker\" has an extremely long prehensile tongue, which it uses to grab and strangle them until they are rescued or dead. The \"Tank\" type is essentially a large hulk zombie with the ability to throw rocks, attack the enemies with his fists, or hit cars or other items in order to incapacitate the survivors.</p><p>The health for all of the characters is displayed in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-180\" href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\"> HUD</a>, and characters automatically speak when doing certain actions to facilitate teamwork. Messages are also displayed for players in need of assistance, such as those pinned or caught by advanced zombies. Players may use items such as medkits on themselves or on other teammates.</p><h3>Down But Not Out</h3><p>To force cooperative behavior in the party, Left 4 Dead is filled with situations that incapacitate players, such as attacks by Hunter or Smoker type zombies, or pitfalls such as falling off of ledges, where another character must come and help the victim back to their feet. A player losing all health is not instantaneously fatal, as they will fall to the ground and be able to fire a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\"> sidearm</a> while they wait for a teammate to assist them. If they are hurt too much during this time, are left too long, or if they have already been disabled twice before, they will die and become a spectator. Some instance, such as being hit by a Witch, instantly knock players to the ground. If the players reach a safe house or find one of the many \"respawn rooms\" they can let dead players come back into the game. Players do have the option to play solely with bots, though the game can support up to three other human players in online co-op for the campaigns. If players come in or drop out of the game, the developers claim the AI is solid enough that the switch is almost unnoticeable.</p><h3>A.I.

More zombies!</figcaption></figure><p>An important concept in Left 4 Dead is its \"Director\" AI. The Director controls the pacing of the game to match the players style and skill level. It also adds variety to the same levels since the director will spawn infected in different places. At E3 2008 Valve showed the first level played by two different groups of different skill levels. The inexperienced group stumbled through the game and director sent them less baddies. The experienced group got more tougher bad guys, and led to more on-screen explosions. Specifically a docile gas station for the first group became an exploding war zone for the better group. One Turtle Rock developer stated that they want the player to feel as though they've just barely survived.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1189157-left_4_dead_director_intensity.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189157\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.373417721519\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1189157-left_4_dead_director_intensity.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1189157\"><img alt=\"The AI Director computes each player's \"stress level\" (the green bars)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\" data-width=\"158\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1189157-left_4_dead_director_intensity.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39063/1189157-left_4_dead_director_intensity.jpg 158w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The AI Director computes each player's \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The AI Director computes each player's \"stress level\" (the green bars)</figcaption></figure><p>The Director uses a system of pacing and what is considered a player's \"stress level\" as determined by your actions to give you the best experience possible. The game plays with peaks of high tension and valleys of quiet fear with few zombies, thanks to the Director reading how stressed the player becomes. When the Director 'feels' that you are being overwhelmed, the gameplay will ease up a bit. Players can have fun with the Director by entering sv_cheats in the console and setting the Director to constant \"panic\" mode. After that, the next event in-game will cause an almost neverending tide of hordes to attack the player. This proves the Director controls the game's pacing. It is assumed that the changes in stress for the player become diminished on the higher difficulties, obviously due to there being more zombies per level.</p><h3>Not Completely Random</h3><p>While the AI Director creates a dynamic experience, avoiding <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2039\" href=\"/scripted-events/3015-2039/\"> scripted</a> enemy attacks that can make a map feel stale and boring after a number of playthroughs, as well as adding bonus items such as weapons randomly in a level, there are still some slightly scripted events. For example, in the first subsection of the Mercy Hospital scenario, there are a number of abandoned cars outside the subway entrance that if disturbed by the players by either bumping into them or firing at them will trigger the car alarms, causing the AI Director to spawn a zombie attack which the players must then fight off or escape. Valve has also mentioned \"crescendo\" events that occur during the game, where the four survivors have to survive an onslaught of infected for a specific amount of time. These crescendo events are one of the few events that always occur at the same location every single game, but the amount of common and special infected is still decided by the Director on the fly.</p><h3>Narrative</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-938445\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-938445\"><img alt=\"Left 4 Dead - Survivor Communication.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 1680w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Left 4 Dead - Survivor Communication.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 1680w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5755/938445-l4d_hospital04_interior0000.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Left 4 Dead - Survivor Communication.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of choosing a storyline for the players to follow, the developers decided upon using a looser form of narrative similar to the style of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\" href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\"> Portal</a>. The opening cut-scene serves to be as much a training video as it is a introduction to the world. The four playable character's personalities are established and four of the five special infected are shown, excluding the Boomer. Additionally concepts such as the shoves and the flashlight are shown. The only information that the player is given is that the infection has spread quickly, taking only two weeks to turn the majority of civilization into zombies.</p><p>The campaigns themselves do not have any voice over or story. In the opening seconds of the first section of the campaign, one of the player characters will give an overview of the objective for the campaign after a brief fly-by. Otherwise all of the story occurs via scribblings on the walls of safe houses by previous survivors (see picture on left). These can be humorous messages such as a forum style flame-war with the conclusion of \"I miss the internet,\" or can help to give the players motivation on what they do want to achieve. A few of the scribblings are hints at achievements, such as killing 53,595 infected. The source, cause, and type of the infection is never directly discussed in the game, but there are hints that it was caused by one of the mega-corporations now trying to clean up the mess. Perhaps the now most famous wall scribbling found in the game is from an apparent survivor who calls himself \"Chicago Ted\" and wrote \"No zombie is safe from Chicago Ted.\"</p><h2>Special Infected</h2><p>The game has regular Infected which are encountered throughout the game and have no special abilities or traits at their disposal. Apart from them there are 5 Special Infected in the game, 4 of which are only playable in Versus mode and all of which will be seen (non-playable) in the Campaign mode.

If killed, the special infected have to wait for the respawn timer to run down.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>These are the weapons found in Left 4 Dead:</p><h3>Pistols</h3><p>You start with a single pistol and can find another during the game for dual pistols. Pistols have infinite ammunition.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Pistol</td><td>A simple pistol. You always start out with it and it has unlimited ammunition. It holds 15 round per magazine</td></tr><tr><td>Dual Pistols</td><td>Hold two pistols means twice the amount of bullets and firepower. You can fire them as fast as you can pull the trigger. Dual pistols have 30 rounds. The reload speed is twice as long as one pistol.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Basic Weapons</h3><p>At the start of a campaign you can pick up an Uzi or shotgun. When respawning, you'll have a basic weapon depending on the weapon you had upon death.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Uzi</td><td>Fast rate of fire and fairly accurate, but a little weak. Best used for medium distance to short distance. Holds 50 bullets at once. You can carry 480 rounds. It may seem like a lot of ammo, but you'll soon realize that bullets go fast.</td></tr><tr><td>Shotgun</td><td>Slow rate of fire, wide burst and powerful blasts. Best used in close quarters against multiple infected. Holds 8 shells at once and you can carry a total of 128 shells.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Advanced Weapons</h3><p>From later in the first map of a campaign and forward, you can find these weapons in random spots. Later levels have these weapons in the safe room.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Automatic Shotgun</td><td>More powerful than the regular shotgun and shoots at a much faster rate. Holds 10 shells at once and you can carry a total of 128 shells. Great for clearing out rooms of Infected</td></tr><tr><td>Assault Rifle</td><td>Very high rate of fire and is accurate at long range when standing still. It holds 50 rounds per magazine and you can carry a total of 360 rounds. The assault rifle burns through ammo very fast, forcing the player to make shots count rather than spraying in every direction.</td></tr><tr><td>Hunting Rifle</td><td>Has a scope. Kills regular zombies in a single shot and shots have bullet penetration, meaning that it's possible to kill multiple zombies in a single shot if they're lined up in a row. Holds 15 rounds per magazine and you can carry a total of 180 rounds.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Grenades</h3><p>The grenades of Left 4 Dead can be found throughout the game in random spots. Only one grenade can be carried at once.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Pipe Bomb</td><td>The pipe bomb is a home made weapon that has a simple smoke detector attached to it. When thrown, the pipe bomb emits a beeping sound that attracts zombies. Using a pipe bomb is a good strategy to distract zombies if a player has been vomited on by a Boomer or if the team is overwhelmed. The pipe bomb explodes after a set amount of time once thrown.</td></tr><tr><td>Molotov</td><td>A molotov cocktail that sets an area on fire. This fire damages both Survivors and zombies and they will continue to burn in flames for a while after leaving the area of effect. The molotov explodes on impact when thrown but can bounce off walls.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Explosives</h3><p>There are three types of explosives that can be randomly found around the levels in Left 4 Dead. Explosives take the place of your weapon's slot (you still have your 2 weapons) and you can carry them anywhere in the level but cannot shoot until you put them down. Both explosives require that you shoot them to activate them, and you can melee with the explosives in hand if need be.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Gasoline Container</td><td>The gas container is like a bigger, meaner version of the Molotov cocktail. It has a wider area of effect and lasts much longer. Be very careful when placing these because you can easily and unintentionally light your companions on fire if it gets caught in the crossfire. These are best used on the final chapters of each level because the zombies will just run into the fire if you are able to place them in their path towards you.</td></tr><tr><td>Propane Tank</td><td>The propane tank explodes when shot and has a rather large area of effect. Best used against large clumps of Infected</td></tr><tr><td>Oxygen Tank</td><td>Similar to the propane tank, but when shot it leaks a but of oxygen before exploding. Essentially on a timed fuse.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Misc</h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Mounted Machine Gun</td><td>A heavy duty weapon which is mounted and controlled by one person at a time. It has unlimited ammo but will overheat if fired for too long. It can only shoot in front from left to right so the Survivor operating it is vulnerable to attacks from behind if not protected. It is usually found at \"crescendo events\" which force the Survivors to defend themselves against the Infected for a certain period of time.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Censored Version in Germany</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1662723\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3655172413793\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1662723\"><img alt=\"German L4D's Boxart\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"German L4D's Boxart\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1662723-capture.png 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>German L4D's Boxart</figcaption></figure><p>In Germany, Left 4 Dead has been censored to comply with standards set by the Ministry for protection of minors.

This DLC was available for free download on April 21,2009 for PC and Xbox 360. Survival mode pits your team against never ending waves of infected in one of 15 selected locations from the existing campaigns as you try to survive for as long as possible. The DLC also includes a new map exclusively for Survival Mode called 'Last Stand', Leaderboards and fixes many bugs and exploits from the previous version of the game.</p><p>The PC version also includes the Source Software Development Kit and new achievements for the 'Survival' mode.</p><p>On 15 May, 2009, Left 4 Dead 'Game of the Year' Edition released for PC and Xbox 360 at retail and came with all previously available DLC on the disc.</p><p>A new map, titled \"Crash Course\", was released on September 29, 2009.

Founder of the Phoenix International Corporation, Drake has been entrusted with dismantling warheads throughout the world. Although his efforts are purportedly philanthropic, Intelligence suspects that Drake is organizing the theft of a secret component of the missile guidance hardware intended for the U.S. Space Weapons Platform. With the help from Q and other key agents, James Bond must travel to exotic locales, including under water and to space, in order to stop Drake before he succeeds in taking over the world.</p><p>Although <a href=\"/pierce-brosnan/3040-89827/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89827\">Pierce Brosnan</a> appears on the cover of the game, and the James Bond model bears his likeness, Bond is actually voiced by Maxwell Caulfield, whose vocal performance is not based on Brosnan.</p><h2>Allies</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/zoe-nightshade/3005-3381/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3381\"><b>Zoe Nightshade</b></a> - An old ally and rising CIA field agent.

The stages themselves are more epansive than traditional racing courses and offer many different routes through each level, leading to hidden short cuts and areas which can be explored. These hidden areas also contain collectable items, such as finding special emblems and Chaos Emeralds which unlock extra characters and stages.</p><p>As in most Sonic games, rings are an important element of Sonic R. As well as offering protection, rings are used to open up gates that lead to hidden areas and Chaos Emeralds, and are also used on speed boosts to increase the player's speed. Power ups are also a key feature of Sonic R, such as the lightning shield and water shield from Sonic the Hedgehog 3.</p><p>There are multiple game modes within Sonic R. Most notably is the Grand Prix, where all four stages can be played in order. There is also a Time Attack mode and a host of multiplayer options including a standard versus race, a tag style race where player's must chase after each other and capture them, and a balloon game, where the player must find and pop five balloons before their opponent.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>There are four playable characters available at the start of Sonic R, with five more that can be unlocked. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, such as increased speed or the ability to run or glide over water. The playable characters are:</p><h3><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></h3><p>Sonic is the fastest of the characters available at the beginning, with quick acceleration at the expense of handling. He has the ability to perform a double jump.</p><h3><a href=\"/tails/3005-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-45\">Miles \"Tails\" Prower</a></h3><p>Tails has fairly good speed and acceleration and also retains his trademark ability of flight, enabling him to reach areas other characters may not.</p><h3><a href=\"/knuckles/3005-204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-204\">Knuckles the Echidna</a></h3><p>Knuckles is an all round character with decent speed and acceleration. He also retains his trademark ability of gliding, allowing him to create his own short cuts.</p><h3><a href=\"/amy-rose/3005-948/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-948\">Amy Rose</a></h3><p>Amy is one of the characters that uses a car to race, which can float over water. Her car is quite slow but has the ability to boost.</p><h3><a href=\"/dr-robotnik/3005-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-293\">Dr Robotnik</a></h3><p>Dr Robotnik is the other character that uses a car to race, which is slow with poor acceleration but can float over water. He has the ability of shooting missiles. He is one of the <a href=\"/unlockables/3015-1414/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1414\">unlockable</a> characters.</p><h3><a href=\"/metal-sonic/3005-2273/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2273\">Metal Sonic</a></h3><p>The Metal Sonic is a robotic version of Sonic that can jump higher than other characters. He is one of the unlockable characters.</p><h3>Tails Doll</h3><p>The Tails Doll is a robotic version of Tails that can float over water without slowing down. He is one of the unlockable characters.</p><h3>EggRobo</h3><p>The EggRobo is a robotic version of Dr Robotnik with similar abilities and speed. He is one of the unlockable characters.</p><h3>Mecha Knuckles</h3><p>The Mecha Knuckles is a robotic version of Knuckles which is slightly faster than Knuckles. He is one of the unlockable characters.</p><h3><a href=\"/super-form/3015-5834/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5834\">Super Sonic</a></h3><p>Super Sonic is arguably the best character of the game and also the hardest to obtain, as he requires all of the Chaos Emeralds. Super Sonic is the fastest of all the characters and can run across water. He is one of the unlockable characters.</p><h2>Stages</h2><p>There are four initial stages within Sonic R to choose from, whilst the final stage is unlocked when all four stages are completed in first place. Those stages are:</p><h4>Resort Island</h4><p>A traditional tropical stage based around the beach and mountains with a waterfall at the beginning of the stage.</p><h3>Radical City</h3><p>A city at night based around old Sonic leves such as Casino Night. Within the middle of the stage is a pinball-style area.</p><h3>Regal Ruin</h3><p>A ruined Egyptian themed stage at sunset, which contains imagery similar to Angel Island from Sonic the Hedgehog 3.</p><h3>Reactive Factory</h3><p>A futuristic factory, similar to the fortresses of Dr Robotnik's lairs of previous Sonic games.</p><h3>Radiant Emerald</h3><p>A beautiful stage set in space with a transparent ground, this is the longest of the stages and must be unlocked.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The music in Sonic R was composed by Richard Jacques and features pop-heavy songs performed by the British singer, TJ Davis. Those songs include:</p><h3>Can You Feel the Sunshine?</h3><p>- For Resort Island.</p><h3>Living in the City</h3><p>- For Radical City</p><h3>Back in Time</h3><p>- For Regal Ruin</p><h3>Work it Out -</h3><p>For Reactive Factory</p><h3>Diamond in the Sky</h3><p>- For Radiant Emerald</p><h3>Super Sonic Racing</h3><p>- The Sonic R main theme and course track for Radiant Emerald if playing as Super Sonic</p><h3>Numer One</h3><p>- The Sonic R Ending Theme and Credits</p><p>Plus two extra bonus tracks:</p><p>Super Sonic Racing - X-Tra Club Mix</p><p>Work it Out - Red Raw Mix</p><p>Each stage also has an instrumental version which can be switched on and off within the game options menu.</p><h2>The Tails Doll Legacy</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131447/1801576-tailsdoll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1801576\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131447/1801576-tailsdoll.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1801576\"><img alt=\"Buy the Gamecube version to induce 60 pains per second.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131447/1801576-tailsdoll.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131447/1801576-tailsdoll.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>Buy the Gamecube version to induce 60 pains per second.</figcaption></figure><p>Tails Doll, one of the unlockable characters in Sonic R, evolved into an internet meme shortly after the release of <a href=\"/sonic-gems-collection/3030-14113/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14113\">Sonic Gem Collection</a>, as the collection was the first to introduce many players to Sonic R.</p> If players select Tails Doll in Sonic R the track \"Can You Feel The Sunshine\" plays regardless of the track selected. At all times Tails Doll floats lifelessly, eyes wide with a face void of any expression. These factors contribute to Tails Doll becoming an internet icon of evil and the perpetual myth that Tails Doll has the ability to curse players.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Easter Egg</h2><p>Putting the game disk into a standard CD player would play the in game soundtrack.

The game most notably introduced two major characters: <a href=\"/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-811\">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, a black hedgehog with upward-curled quills, amnesia problems, and a singular focus on finding out his reason for existence, and <a href=\"/rouge-the-bat/3005-2366/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2366\">Rouge the Bat</a>, a large-breasted treasure hunter who harbors a healthy obsession with jewels, both of whom appear in more subsequent games than any new character introduced afterward.</p><p>Where Sonic Adventure 2's predecessor was focused on telling a multilayered story with numerous protagonists, this game took a more refined approach; instead of selecting which individual character to play as when starting the adventure, the choice was only between which faction to play, \"Hero\" (featuring <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic</a>, <a href=\"/tails/3005-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-45\">Tails</a>, and <a href=\"/knuckles/3005-204/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-204\">Knuckles</a>) or \"Dark\" (featuring Shadow, <a href=\"/dr-eggman/3005-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-293\">Eggman</a>, and Rouge), and experiencing the same events from the perspective of either set of characters. In terms of gameplay, both sport similar styles (though Dark assumes that the Hero campaign has been completed first, and is noticeably more difficult in comparison); Sonic/Shadow stages focus on running through stages that have been streamlined for speed, Tails/Eggman stages feature their characters piloting mechanical walking units with ballistic/missile capabilities, and Knuckles/Rouge stages deal with their characters flying around enormous stages to find objects (usually shards of the Master Emerald) in groups of three, usually to eclectic and interesting music.</p><p>An additional feature of Sonic Adventure 2 was the inclusion of an improved Chao Garden from the original <a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure</a>. After levels, players are able to find Chao Boxes that contain a key to enter Chao World after completing the level. After unlocking Chao World, it can also be accessed from the mission selection screen. After hatching Chao, they can participate in Chao Races and Chao Karate. In order to do well, it is important to raise the Chao's skills. To do so, players can collect Chaos Drives, animals, or feed the Chao fruit. After some time, Chao can evolve to adult forms that depend on what type of character, Hero or Dark, was used to raise it and what stat is the highest.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Hoping to find some sort of weapon, Dr. Eggman unseals his grandfather's greatest invention, Project Shadow, for the first time in 50 years. What he finds instead is a black hedgehog, claiming his name is Shadow. Now free, Shadow promises to grant Doctor Eggman one wish - but first he must meet him at the Space Colony ARK.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611779\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74857142857143\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611779\"><img alt=\"\"I'm outta here!\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg 350w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\"I'm outta here!\"</figcaption></figure><p>A week later, Sonic the Hedgehog finds himself on the run from the Military Organization, G.U.N (Guardian Unit of Nations), who claim Sonic is a dangerous criminal. Unaware of what is going on, Sonic attempts to avoid capture when he encounters Shadow the Hedgehog, who is in the middle of stealing a Chaos Emerald. Putting two and two together, Sonic assumes the Military is mistaking Shadow for Sonic (and vice versa), and this \"fake\" Hedgehog is the reason Sonic is in so much trouble. Before Sonic can engage Shadow in battle, however, Shadow vanishes in to thin air using a power called \"Chaos Control\", leaving Sonic surrounded by dozens of fully-armed G.U.N soldiers.</p><h3>Rouge's Report</h3><p>After Sonic Adventure 2 hit retail, SonicTeam published the Official Sonic Adventure 2 Strategy Guide in Japan, which contained \"The Last Report on Project Shadow\", written by the in-game character Rouge the Bat, in an effort to uncover the mystery of who - or what Shadow is, and where he came from. A summary of the report follows:</p><blockquote><p>50 years ago, the current President of Nations contracted Professor Gerald Robotnik to research the possibility of immortality. Gerald initially refused, comparing it to to playing God. But when his niece, Maria Robotnik, contracted the terminal (and as-of-yet incurable) disease NIDS (Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome), Gerald reconsidered the project as a means to extend her life. The top-secret \"Project Shadow\" (as it became to be known due to the secrecy of the research) took place on the Space Colony known as ARK and began researching the effects of Chaos Emeralds on living tissue.</p><p>One experiment, designed to accelerate the rate of cell regeneration seen in some species of lizards, turned disastrous - the \"Biolizard\" subject grew ten times its normal size and became violent, nearly killing several scientists before being contained. When Military Organization G.U.N learned of the disaster aboard the ARK, they sprung in to action in order to silence Project Shadow (violently, if necessary). When they arrived aboard the ARK, Professor Gerald was already putting the finishing touches on what he called the \"Ultimate Life-form\", an immortal black hedgehog, named after the project he was born from: Shadow. Not knowing what the military would do with something like Shadow, Gerald entrusted Maria to take him to an escape pod and head down to the planet below.</p><p>They were intercepted by G.U.N soldiers, who, in an effort to kill Shadow, accidentally shoot Maria. With her last dying breath, she sealed Shadow in the escape pod and ejected him to earth. When Professor Gerald heard the news of his niece's death, he flew in to a rage; the very project he took part in to save her life ended up being the key to her death. Before being captured by G.U.N and sentenced to death for the \"accident\" on ARK, Professor Gerald gave Shadow strict instructions to carry out his revenge for what happened to Maria. Shadow was sealed in stasis to ensure that the truth about what happened on the ARK was never revealed.</p></blockquote><h2>Other Info</h2><p>2 players simultaneous</p><p>Memory blocks needed: <b>11</b></p><p>Game Boy Advance compatible</p><h2>Levels</h2><h3>Hero</h3><ul><li><b>SONIC</b>: City Escape</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Wild Canyon</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Prison Lane</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Metal Harbor</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Green Forest</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Pumpkin Hill</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Mission Street</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Aquatic Mine</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Route 101</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Hidden Base</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Pyramid Cave</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Death Chamber</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Eternal Engine</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Meteor Herd</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Crazy Gadget</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Final Rush</li></ul><h3>Dark</h3><ul><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Iron Gate</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Dry Lagoon</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Sand Ocean</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Radical Highway</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Egg Quarters</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Lost Colony</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Weapons Bed</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Security Hall</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: White Jungle</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Route 280</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Sky Rail</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Mad Space</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Cosmic Wall</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Final Chase</li></ul><h3>Last Story</h3><ul><li><b>ALL</b>: Cannon's Core</li></ul><h3>Unlockable</h3><ul><li><b>SONIC</b>: <a href=\"/green-hill-zone/3035-144/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-144\">Green Hill Zone</a></li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p><a href=\"/jun-senoue/3040-38321/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38321\">Jun Senoue</a> returns to lend his unmistakable 80's Hair Band music styles to the game's soundtrack, and he is backed up by <a href=\"/fumie-kumatani/3040-74739/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74739\">Fumie Kumatani</a>, <a href=\"/kenichi-tokoi/3040-54819/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-54819\">Kenichi Tokoi</a> and <a href=\"/tomoya-ohtani/3040-40721/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40721\">Tomoya Ohtani</a>.

Normally he is controlled by the computer and fights enemies on his own. However, a second player can take control of him and play along simultaneously with the first player. Gooey has almost all of the same moves as Kirby does, except that he heats things with a long <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a>-like tongue instead of inhaling them. Gooey can be summoned at any time, but to do so Kirby must surrender a bar of his life meter, which will remain gone until Gooey leaves. Between them, Kirby and Gooey can only ride on one animal helper at a time. Kirby can recover his health at any time by swallowing Gooey.</p><h3>Hearts</h3><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086737\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086737\"><img alt=\"Fancy meeting you here.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fancy meeting you here.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1086737-gfs_45302_2_21.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fancy meeting you here.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To truly complete the game Kirby must earn a heart on every stage. To do this he must accomplish a mission that helps a character that hangs out at the end of every level. Looking at the character should normally give the player a hint as to what they should do to complete the mission. Examples of missions include stomping on flowers of a certain color but leaving others alone, or completing a level with a certian animal helper to show off to the character at the end. Some levels even featured cameos by other Nintendo characters; one level's heart character was <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a>, who would give Kirby a heart if he destroyed all of the <a href=\"/metroid/3015-1081/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1081\">Metroids</a>, which only appear in that level.</p>", "deck": "Kirby and his friend Gooey notice a large dark cloud spreading over their peaceful planet of PopStar.

This world was once a Sacred Realm until Ganon arrived and used the <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> to bend the realm to his will, covering the land with darkness and despair. Throughout the course of the game, Link must travel between the Light World and the Dark World in order to complete certain puzzles and progress through the game's story. Some areas of the Light and Dark worlds are identical, but others have minute differences that alter Link's ability to travel through them. At first, Link is transformed into a reflection of his inner self whenever entering the Dark World, which leaves him unable to use items or wield a sword and shield, but eventually he collects an item that allows him to maintain his form while traveling through the Dark World (much to the surprise of the world's natural inhabitants).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459118\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.71701112877583\" data-width=\"629\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 629px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459118\"><img alt=\"World Map of the Light World.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 629w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"World Map of the Light World.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 629w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>World Map of the Light World.</figcaption></figure><p>About half of the game takes place in the Light World. Link must win three pendants in order to obtain the Master Sword, as well as defeat Agahnim at the top of Hyrule Castle. Most of the second half of the game takes place in the Dark World, where Link must revisit the seven <a href=\"/temple/3035-1263/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1263\">temples</a> which differ from their Light World counterparts significantly. While traversing the Dark World dungeons, it is sometimes necessary to travel to the Light World to <a href=\"/physics-manipulation/3015-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-88\">manipulate</a> an object, and then return to the Dark World where a consequence of that manipulation will allow Link to progress further.

Exploration of the towns and <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> is broken up by dungeon exploration, which involves solving puzzles and facing enemies, including a <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss</a> and a <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">miniboss</a>.

He can level up after getting 100 star points (experience points) and choose to upgrade his health, his flower points, or his badge points. The only way you can increase how much damage he gives and receives is by finding equipment throughout the game to upgrade his boots and hammer. You can also find badges that upgrade his stats.</li><li><a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"><b>Peach</b></a>: Peach is captured in the X-Naut base. There are portions of the game where you play as Peach to find out more information a bout the X-Nauts to help out Mario.</li><li><b>TEC</b>: TEC is the mega-computer for the X-Nauts and is built under the notion that it is absolutely perfect in every way. TEC is capable of having emotions although it is not exactly sure what those are and uses Peach to find out what it is. Despite being \"perfect\", TEC overrides its original programming and begins helping Peach by letting her find out more information about the X-Nauts and then relaying that information to Mario on his cell phone.</li></ul><h2>Partners</h2><p>During The Thousand-Year Door, Mario finds lots of partners who tag along during his journey.

He also brings different partners with him every time, whose stories of the events are often very different from that of Luigi's.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Battles</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-653014\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-653014\"><img alt=\"Mario engaged in combat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario engaged in combat.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653014-papermario1.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario engaged in combat.</figcaption></figure><p>The Thousand-Year Door continues the interactive turn-based battle system that Mario RPGs have been known for. Unlike most turn-based RPGs, you cannot merely pick a move and watch a cinematic. Instead, you are prompted to do button commands while pulling off the move. Performing the action commands correctly will yield higher damage. For example, if you were to jump on a Goomba, you could push A right when you land on the Goomba and Mario will do a double-jump attack. You can also push A or B while being attacked to lower the amount of damage received or do a counter-attack and damage the enemy a small amount. In addition, Mario can jump on top of the enemy or hit them with his hammer outside in the overworld to damage enemies before the battle even begins. However, the enemy has this ability as well.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-653082\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.78947368421053\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-653082\"><img alt=\"Mario using the special move, Earth Tremor.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg 608w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario using the special move, Earth Tremor.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg 608w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2714/653082-papermario2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario using the special move, Earth Tremor.</figcaption></figure><p>As Mario obtains more Crystal Stars, he gets special moves he can use in battle. For these special moves, you must play a mini-game in battle to receive the benefits. These moves involve causing massive damage, healing Mario and his partner, and boosting Mario\u2019s attack and defense stats. These mini-games include a variety of things. One of them makes you try to draw a circle around the enemy as many times as possible to cause damage, while others make you time button-pushing in order to damage the enemy. The more Crystal Stars Mario gets, the bigger his star meter gets, which lets him pull off bigger special moves and lets him use the smaller ones more often. One of The Thousand-Year Door\u2019s more unique battle features is how the game takes place on a stage. As the battle starts to get more chaotic, props will fall down on the combatants, stage crew will accidentally drop lights, and there is even crowd that will get involved with the battle. If Mario and his partners pull of the action commands correctly, more spectators will join the crowd. The reverse also holds true; if Mario and his partners fail to perform moves correctly, crowd members will start leaving. Mario can also get style points by pushing certain buttons (The game doesn\u2019t tell you; you have to find out about style moves by experimenting) after performing the action command. Getting the crowd really excited will help refill your star meter so Mario can perform more special moves. Crowd members will also throw items at Mario; it could either be an item to regain health, or a hammer to cause harm. Mario or one of his other party members can quickly jump on top of the crowd members to stop the item from being thrown and effectively scare that spectator away.</p><h3>Special Moves</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Crystal Star Required</th><th>Power</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Map</td><td>Sweet-Treat</td><td>Can replenish up to 7HP and 8FP for both party members and cure status aliments.</td></tr><tr><td>Diamond Star</td><td>Earth Tremor</td><td>Causes an earthquake which can do up to 6 damage to all ground based enemies.</td></tr><tr><td>Emerald Star</td><td>Clock Out</td><td>Immobilizes all enemies temporarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Gold Star</td><td>Power Lift</td><td>Boost attack and defense power for both party members temporarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Ruby Star</td><td>Art Attack</td><td>Circles the enemies as many times as possible to cause damage to them all.</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire Star</td><td>Sweet Feast</td><td>Similar to Sweet-Treat, but Mario and his partner can replenish up to 24HP and 24FP.</td></tr><tr><td>Garnet Star</td><td>Showstopper</td><td>If done successfully, will KO all enemies unless they have more than 12HP or are classed as a 'boss'.</td></tr><tr><td>Crystal Star</td><td>Super Nova</td><td>Can causes a total of 15 damage too all enemies.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Levels</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233658\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.68367346938776\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1233658\"><img alt=\"The Glitz Pit, a battle arena located in Glitzville.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg 392w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Glitz Pit, a battle arena located in Glitzville.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1233658-glitz_pit.jpg 392w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" data-width=\"392\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Glitz Pit, a battle arena located in Glitzville.</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of battle there are some fairly simple puzzles that must be solved. These usually involve using the partners\u2019 special abilities. There are also many paper forms that Mario can turn into. These involve turning into a paper airplane, a paper roll up, a paper boat, and more. These forms all help move about levels in ways that couldn\u2019t be accessed by foot. There also parts of the game where you can play as Peach and Bowser. In the parts where you play as Peach, you move around in the base that she is captured in to collect more information about the enemy. She then uses the computer, TEC, to send emails to Mario about this information.</p><h2>Bonus Missions</h2><p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door contains plenty of bonus missions outside of the main quest line. including side-quests, collectibles and challenges.</p><h3>Trouble Center Side Quests</h3><p>The Trouble Center is where Mario goes to collect side quests, these quests can range from finding a lost key in Rougeport or finding the prices of items in a shop to more harder quests such as finding legendary cook books to finding hidden badges that certain a thief wants.</p><h3>The Pit of 100-Trials</h3><p>The Pit of 100-Trials is located underneath Rougeport, it consists of 100 floors going down, each floor contains an enemy, each floor get gradually harder until you get to the 100th floor where you face Bonetail, Hooktail's and Gloomtail's long lost relative. Every 10th floor of the pit is a safe floor where you can rest, save the game, buy items or badges or leave the pit.</p><h3>Badges</h3><p>Badges can be equipped onto Mario giving him extra abilities, these badges can be obtained by finding them in the environment, buying them from shops, trading star pieces for them or being gifted them by characters from the game. Each badge has certain badge points which Mario only has a certain amount he can equip, he can get more BP by leveling up. The most rarest badges in the game can change Mario's attire, the W emblem changes his attire to Wario, the L emblem changes his attire to Luigi, and if they're both equipped Mario will wear Waluigi's attire.</p><h3>Zess T.'s Food</h3><p>Once you buy a replacement contact lens for Zess T. she will let you into the West side of Rougeport, but she also cooks items for you, you can turn items into more useful food items. If you give Zess T. the legendary cookbook from Creepy Steeple she will be able to cook two ingredients at the same time for you.</p><h3>Tattle Log</h3><p>One of Goombella's abilities is Tattle which allows her to show you the enemies HP, defense and attack power. Once she tattles an enemy it goes into her tattle log. There are 124 separate enemies in the game which have to be tattled to fill up the Tattle Log.</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p>1 player</p><p>Memory blocks needed: <b>17</b></p><p>Progressive Scan compatible (480p)</p><p>Dolby Pro Logic II</p>", "deck": "In his second paper-themed adventure, Mario must once again rescue the captured princess while he foils the X-Nauts' plans.

The game was intended as a tribute to the MSX and was primarily inspired by MSX game <a href=\"/knightmare-ii-the-maze-of-galious/3030-20383/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20383\">Maze of Galious</a>. The game was also designed to remind players the era of difficult 8-bit games, and is thus known both its difficulty as a platformer, its difficult puzzles, and its lack of guidance to the player. The game was originally only released in Japan, but an English translation patch is now available. The freeware version and translation patch may be found in a zip file located <a href=\"http://lamulana.super-turbo.net/LA-MULANA.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p><p>A <a href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-87\">WiiWare</a> remake with updated graphics, lowered difficulty, and other modifications was released in Japan in 2011 with a localization for western markets in the works that was supposed to be published by <a href=\"/nicalis-inc/3010-6661/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6661\">Nicalis</a> but due to the long development time to pass <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> of Europe/America's certification process, Nicalis stepped back from their publishing agreement. <a href=\"/nigoro/3010-8102/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8102\">Nigoro</a>, developer of the remake version, eventually announced that the remake would be available on July 13, 2012 for PC via Playism (playism-games.com), a digital distribution service for indie games. In a statement, Nigoro promised they are still attempting to release the WiiWare version in western territories but that version would not include the DLC features like the Hell Temple when it gets released. On August 29 2012, it was revealed on Nintendo's US-website that La-Mulana would finally make its way onto the North American and European WiiWare service via publisher <a href=\"/enjoyup/3010-2182/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2182\">EnjoyUp</a> on September 20, 2012 for 1000 Nintendo Points.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>La Mulana follows the trail of Lemeza, an Indiana Jones-style explorer entering the ruins of La Mulana after receiving a mysterious note from his long-missing father Shorn. As he explores La Mulana, Lemeza learns more of the ruins, its guardians, and its inhabitants, and is presented with an ultimate task to complete.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>La Mulana plays much like traditional Metroid and Castlevania style games. The character begins only with a whip and very low amount of life. As the player explores he gains more life and gathers new weapons, projectile subweapons, and equipment. Much like the original <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\">Metroid</a>, upon entering the ruins of La Mulana the player is given little guidance as to where to go or what to do. While certain equipment is often necessary to proceed at times, the game is open-ended and allows the player to freely explore the many areas of the ruins. Usually there is no obvious route for the player to take or proper sequence for challenges to be completed in.</p><p>Known for its difficulty, La Mulana is filled with puzzles, traps, dead-ends, annoying enemies, and challenging bosses. Many of the puzzles are solved by reading various tablets around the ruins which have hint text or pictures written on them. The skeletons of previous failed explorers can also provide guidance if examined. Doors may also be entered containing advice-providing creatures or shops, similar to the original <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">Zelda</a>. Due to the game's difficulty often players must explore and solve as much as they can before retreating to the entrance to save and restore their life. An item is gained early on which allows <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleportation</a> among visited areas and back to the entrance, encouraging just such a tactic.</p><p>The game also scattered various MSX \"Roms\" hidden throughout the ruins, most representing old MSX games. Many of these roms are just useless collectibles, while others provided bonuses, abilities, or easter eggs if used by the player. A smaller fraction of roms are necessary tools for the player, providing the ability to translate text in the ruins, teleport to parts of the ruins, or even save the game. The player starts the game with an MSX computer which may run roms, and may be upgraded with a handi-scanner for reading and dual cartridge capability for running rom combinations.</p><p>While exploration, equipment gathering, and puzzle solving are the primary motivations for the player, La Mulana also contains an overarching plot to be revealed and challenge to be completed by the player. Each area contains a boss to be unlocked and beaten and a series of final challenges and puzzles will unlock a final boss. However, even after the ending there are a series of even more gruesome challenges, appropriately entitled the Hell Temple, available for the player to conquer.</p><h2><b>Locations</b></h2><p><b>Surface</b> - The starting area of the game. Location of the village Elder who provides advice and comments on old MSX games. The Elder also allows the player to save the game if the Game Master Rom is equipped. Also has several shops, hidden items, and the entrance to the ruins of La Mulana.</p><p>Aside from the Surface, each area contains a \"Frontside\" and a \"Backside\" version which are often interconnected. Many of the Frontside areas can be explored initially by the player, while the Backside areas often need to be unlocked. While the areas are numbered by the game, there are numerous passages between them and there is no set order for exploring them.</p><p>Each Backside/Frontside pair of areas contain a Life Jewel which expands the player's life bar, an Ankh Jewel which is used to unlock one of the eight Guardians, and a Guardian to be unlocked and defeated in the Frontside area.</p><h3>Frontside Areas</h3><p><b>Guidance Gate -</b> Initial area connected to the Surface. Contains advice for beginners, and introductions to the puzzles, traps, and general gameplay of La Mulana. Importantly contains the Shiruken subweapon and the Grail, which allows for teleportation to the Surface initially and the areas of the ruins later after certain tablets are decoded.</p><p><b>Mausoleum of the Giants</b> - Usually the second area to be entered. Primarily centers around the race of the Giants, whose stories can be discovered by reading the tablets within. Contains the Throwing Knife subweapon.</p><p><b>Temple of the Sun</b> - Usually the third area to be entered. Has an obvious Egyptian motif, including a huge pyramid-shaped temple at its center. Important items include the Knife, and the speed-enhancing Boots.</p><p><b>Spring in the Sky - </b>Usually the fourth area to be entered. Filled with water, which initially damages the player to swim in, and waterfalls, which force downward players not wearing a Helmet. Also contains the Scalesphere, which allows for travelling underwater, and the first of four Seals, which are necessary to unlock many things within the ruins.</p><p><b>Inferno Cavern</b> - Usually the fifth area to be entered. Filled with lava which is damages the player to swim in until an item is obtained which protects from lava. Noteworthy items include the a more powerful Whip, the Flare Gun subweapon, and the wall-clinging Grapple Claw.</p><p><b>Chamber of Extinction -</b> Usually the sixth area to be entered. Has one section which is cloaked in darkness until the player solves a puzzle in the backside version of this area.</p><p><b>Twin Labryinths</b> - The seventh area and the only one without a true \"backside\" version. Instead, this area contains a left and right side which are mirror images of one another, representing the front and back. Initially very little of this area can be explored. The Twin Statue must be obtained in order to solve a puzzle which lifts a cloud of poison gas over the rest. Contains the Katana weapon and the Comic Bakery Rom, which together with the Antarctic Adventure Rom allows for teleportation to backside areas.</p><p><b>Endless Corridor -</b> The eighth area of the ruins. Notable for its pots emblazoned with the infinity symbol, this area consists of five corridors which wrap around back to the beginning after you travel far enough through them. The Endless Key must be obtained to travel beyond the first corridor, and the remaining corridors must be unlocked through a series of tricky puzzles and challenges. At the bottom of the last corridor lies an entrance to the final area.</p><p><b>Shrine of the Mother</b> - The ninth and final area of the ruins. Contains many of the final plot-driving items in the game. This area only exists until all eight Guardians are defeated, at which point it transforms into its alternate form.</p><h3>Backside Areas</h3><p><b>Confusion Gate -</b> Backside version of the Guidance Gate. Notorious for its many hidden passages and ladders, teleports and dead-ends, and tablets which enjoy mocking the player. Requires much backtracking and puzzle solving to be fully explored.</p><p><b>Graveyard of the Giants -</b> Backside version of the Mausoleum of the Giants. Covered in ice for the most part, making running, jumping, and grappling fairly difficult. Contains the Bomb subweapon, the Silver Shield, and an attack speed increasing Gauntlet.</p><p><b>Temple of Moonlight</b> - Backside version of the Temple of the Sun. Filled with many moving platforms and lizards which blend into the background. Also contains an inverted temple which functions as the mirror image of the temple in the frontside area. Notable items include the Axe and the lava-proof Ice Cape.</p><p><b>Tower of the Goddess</b> - Backside version of the Spring in the Sky. Mostly consists, not surprisingly, of towers to be scaled by the players. Contains the stretch of the game widely considered to the most difficult standard area in the game, a long tower climb that must be done using the Grapple Claw. Also contains enemies which are initially invisible to the player. The final whip upgrade, the Mace, is located here.</p><p><b>Tower of Ruin</b> - Backside version of the Inferno Cavern. Has a destroyed future motif to it. Contains the Spear subweapon, among other items.</p><p><b>Chamber of Birth</b> - Backside version of the Chamber of Extinction. Has elements from both Hebrew and Hindu culture within. Another confusing area which requires liberal use of hidden teleports and passages to travel through. Contains many plot-important items, as well as a puzzle which will light up the darkened area of the Chamber of Extinction.</p><p><b>Dimensional Corridor</b> - Backside version of the Endless Corridor. Unique in that while often considered the backside, the game's story describes the area as being the frontside, warped by the powerful magic of the area's Guardian, Tiamat. This area contains eleven sub-bosses which must be defeated to confront Tiamat. In addition, once the player travels into this area the only way out is through a one-way door, as use of the Grail is blocked within.</p><p><b>True Shrine of the Mother</b> - Alternate version of the Shrine of the Mother. The Shrine of the Mother transforms into this once all eight Guardians are defeated. The transformation removes many of the items within, however, so the player must be sure to fully explore the original Shrine of the Mother before defeating the eight Guardians. The True Shrine contains the final boss of the game, who may be unlocked through a long series of steps.</p><h3>Optional Area</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323765\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56318252730109\" data-width=\"641\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 641px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1323765\"><img alt=\"Hell Temple is Hell\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg 641w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57548/1323765-hell_temple.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Hell Temple is Hell</figcaption></figure><p><b>Hell Temple</b> - The appropriately titled optional area of the game, which may be unlocked through a convoluted and walkthrough-required set of steps available after going through the main plot of the game. Hell Temple pulls no punches in attempting to destroy the player's sanity. Notable challenges include fake platforms, pits and ladders which will send you back to the start, and combinations of the hardest enemies from the game itself. It is most likely one of the hardest video game challenges available. Attempt at your own risk.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p>A new version with updated graphics and mechanics was published on the Japanese WiiWare shop in June 2011 and later ported to PC. Some of the changes in the new version include:</p><ul><li>A redesign of the MSX rom system featuring a design for a more modern laptop computer titled the MobileSuperX. Many programs may be running/equipped at once depending on the memory limit of the model. (This incorporates the removal of the collectible MSX roms for obvious copyright reasons.)</li><li>Lowered difficulty of certain areas, such as the tower climb in the Tower of the Goddess.</li><li>Increasing the ease of use of certain items, such as the grapple claw.</li><li>Making certain puzzles easier to solve and providing additional hints to the player on where to go or what to do.</li><li>Updated graphics and music, changing from old 8-bit style and midi music.</li><li>New subweapons, areas, and enemies.</li></ul><h2>System Requirements (PC)</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS</strong> : Windows XP / Vista / 7</li><li><strong>Processor </strong>: 2 GHz processor</li><li><strong>Memory </strong>: 1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics </strong>: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c, 128 MB VRAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive </strong>: 187 MB available space</li></ul>", "deck": "In this 2D \"Metroidvania\" style platformer, you play as Indiana Jones-inspired archaeologist Lemeza Kosugi, who seeks to uncover an ancient mystery.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1107184-0813_main01.jpg", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1107184-0813_main01.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/la-mulana/3030-22517/", "name": "La-Mulana", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22517/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/", "id": 33, "name": "CERO: B"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/", "abbreviation": "WSHP", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/", "id": 87, "name": "Wii Shop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/", "abbreviation": "PSNV", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/", "id": 143, "name": "PlayStation Network (Vita)"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "date_added": "2008-07-31 06:48:36", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 22517, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": null}, "platform": "Wii", "title": "La-Mulana Remake"}, {"duration": "0:22:00", "runner": "Zic3", "data": {"original_release_date": "2015-04-14 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2015-09-19 03:31:35", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Titan Souls is a top down action game developed by <a href=\"/acid-nerve/3010-10033/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-10033\">Acid Nerve</a> and published by <a href=\"/devolver-digital/3010-6718/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6718\">Devolver Digital</a> for the <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Vita</a>.

At the height of this glorification, shrines were built to them and a Hall of Heroes was constructed, inducting only the most famous of heroes.</p><p>One hundred years later, no new heroes have been invited in and the last six heroes have become corrupt and live off their previous fame. Wryn, the main character, plans to change this. She believes it's time the world meets a new hero - a real hero. In order to gather global recognition as the true hero of the 22nd century, she sets off on a journey to kill the six heroes that were inducted into the Hall. Armed with her dual pistols, a rocket launcher, and ungodly amounts of ammunition, the player must guide her through this journey.</p><p>However, after defeating all six heroes, a stranger dares to steal the credit for her amazing feats! As he broadcasts his declaration of victory and induction into the Hall of Heroes, the world is confused and upset at him, so when Wryn shows up to kill him too, people around the globe align themselves with her.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Story Mode</h3><p>Story mode is the basic style of gameplay and allows the player, or players, to select which level they would like to play from the levels they've unlocked. There are four difficulty levels in Story Mode (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard) and are selected after choosing the level.</p><h3>Arcade Mode</h3><p>Arcade Mode turns the campaign into a rogue-like game, where the player is allowed only a single life. Scores are determined by performance and progression, then recorded onto leaderboards. Co-op games will not be eligible for posting on leaderboards. All four difficulties are enabled in Arcade Mode. Players are also given the option to adjust the amount of health they start with, to add to the challenge.</p><h3>Challenge Mode</h3><p>Challenge Mode allows players to fight up to three bosses or mini-bosses at one time. Players are only able to select opponents they have already defeated, and so, must progress in Story Mode to unlock new enemies. Players may also select the same opponent multiple times. The option to choose a map the player has beaten or the default arena is also offered, with more levels being unlocked as Story Mode nears completion.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><p>Bleed offers <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">local co-op</a> to add one other player.</p><h3>Controller Support</h3><p>Bleed has full controller support on PC, enabling the use of game console controllers or joysticks.</p><h2>Achievements/Unlockables</h2><h3>Unlockable Features</h3><p>Through various feats, players can unlock the following:</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Feature</th><th scope=\"col\">Challenge</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Arcade Mode</td><td>Beat the game</td></tr><tr><td>Character 2</td><td>Beat Story Mode on Normal</td></tr><tr><td>Character 3</td><td>Beat Story Mode on Hard</td></tr><tr><td>Character 4</td><td>Beat Story Mode on Very Hard or Arcade Mode on Easy</td></tr><tr><td>Challenge Mode Chopper Core</td><td>Defeat the Chopper Core mini-boss</td></tr><tr><td>Challenge Mode Guppy</td><td>Defeat Guppy</td></tr><tr><td>Challenge Mode Gibby and Stu</td><td>Defeat Gibby and Stu</td></tr><tr><td>Challenge Mode White Mk.

side-scrolling platformer developed and published by <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. It was originally released in North America in 1989, making its way to Europe and Japan a year later. The game is based on the animated television series of the same name and follows the exploits of multi-billionaire <a href=\"/scrooge-mcduck/3005-5901/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5901\">\"Uncle\" Scrooge McDuck</a> as he embarks on yet another globe-hopping adventure.</p><p>DuckTales was also released on <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> in 1990. While the gameplay of the original NES release was largely unchanged, the portable version features remixed stage layouts to compensate for a reduced screen resolution.</p><p>Thanks to the success of DuckTales, Capcom developed and published <a href=\"/ducktales-2/3030-14532/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14532\">DuckTales 2</a> in 1993 as a direct sequel. The original game also received a full <a href=\"/remake/3015-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\">remake</a> with the release of <a href=\"/ducktales-remastered/3030-42035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42035\">DuckTales: Remastered</a> in 2013.</p><h2>Story</h2><p><a href=\"/scrooge-mcduck/3005-5901/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5901\">Scrooge McDuck</a> is the world's wealthiest individual. On most days he enjoys nothing more than swimming through the great piles of treasure and currency he hoards inside his gigantic \"Money Bin\" located in <a href=\"/duckburg/3035-2571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2571\">Duckburg</a>. Although most multi-billionaires would be content to simply live out the rest of their lives in comfort and luxury, Scrooge is a duck whose insatiable desire for wealth often drives him to the ends of the earth in search of even greater fortune.</p><p>For his latest <a href=\"/treasure-hunting/3015-8131/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8131\">treasure hunt</a>, Uncle Scrooge enlists the aid of his three grand-nephews <a href=\"/huey/3005-13020/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13020\">Huey</a>, <a href=\"/dewey/3005-13021/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13021\">Dewey</a> and <a href=\"/louie/3005-13022/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13022\">Louie</a>, as well as several of Scrooge's other acquaintances and employees. With the help of his friends, Scrooge travels between various exotic locations around the globe (and even <a href=\"/the-moon/3035-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-10\">the Moon</a>) in order to uncover five \"legendary treasures\" and become even wealthier. However, Scrooge's enemies have already staked out each treasure's location in an effort to prevent Scrooge from obtaining these valuable artifacts.</p><h3>Characters</h3><ul><li><strong><a href=\"/scrooge-mcduck/3005-5901/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5901\">Scrooge McDuck</a></strong> - The world's richest duck. The player controls Scrooge and must make good use of his cane-based abilities to collect items and cash.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/huey/3005-13020/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13020\">Huey</a>, <a href=\"/dewey/3005-13021/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13021\">Dewey</a> &amp; <a href=\"/louie/3005-13022/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13022\">Louie</a></strong> - <a href=\"/donald-duck/3005-1754/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1754\">Donald Duck's</a> precocious nephews can be found in various locations throughout the game, usually to offer hints or to restrict areas that Scrooge can't access yet.</li><li><strong>Mrs. Beakley</strong> - Scrooge's live-in <a href=\"/maid/3015-4900/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4900\">maid</a> and nanny to his grand-nephews. She appears in certain levels to offer <a href=\"/healing-food/3015-462/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-462\">life-restoring food</a> for Scrooge.</li><li><strong>Webbigail \"Webby\" Vanderquack</strong> - Mrs. Beakley's granddaughter. Like the duck triplets, she sometimes appears to offer hints.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/launchpad-mcquack/3005-20513/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20513\">Launchpad McQuack</a></strong> - Scrooge's crash-prone aircraft <a href=\"/pilot/3015-5129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5129\">pilot</a>. Launchpad can be found in nearly every level (except Transylvania) and gives Scrooge the option of returning to Duckburg without completing the stage. If certain conditions are met, the player will enter a bonus round. Launchpad can only assist Scrooge once per level. He also helps Scrooge cross a <a href=\"/pit/3015-848/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-848\">bottomless pit</a> in the Amazon.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/gyro-gearloose/3005-13152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13152\">Gyro Gearloose</a></strong> - An eccentric but brilliant <a href=\"/inventor/3015-4048/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4048\">inventor</a> in Scrooge's employ. Gyro shows up only in the bonus level, where he will launch diamonds at Scrooge.</li><li><strong>GizmoDuck </strong>- Scrooge's high-strung accountant Fenton Crackshell reluctantly dons the advanced <a href=\"/cybernetics/3015-2944/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2944\">cybernetic</a> \"Gizmosuit,\" designed by Gyro, in times of peril. After Scrooge acquires the Gizmosuit's Remote Control, GizmoDuck briefly appears in the Moon stage to blast a wall open.</li><li><strong>Bubba the Caveduck</strong> - A prehistoric \"<a href=\"/caveman/3015-3335/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3335\">caveduck</a>\" adopted by Scrooge after <a href=\"/time-travel/3015-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-73\">time-travelling</a> to present-day Duckburg. If he is released from the ice in the Himalayas, Bubba will reward Scrooge with an extra energy slot.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/magica-de-spell/3005-17216/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17216\">Magica De Spell</a></strong> - A powerful sorceress who schemes to steal Scrooge's lucky <a href=\"/number-one-dime/3055-1177/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1177\">Number One Dime</a>. Scrooge first encounters her as as the boss of the Transylvania stage, and then once more at the end of the game.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/flintheart-glomgold/3005-12281/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12281\">Flintheart Glomgold</a></strong> - One of Scrooge's oldest rivals, Flintheart is currently the world's second-richest duck. In the final sequence, Scrooge must race against Flintheart and Magica to reach the last treasure and complete the game.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/beagle-boys/3015-6239/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6239\">The Beagle Boys</a></strong> - A bumbling gang of criminals who constantly attempt to steal Scrooge's fortune. The Beagle Boys show up occasionally in the game, usually as guards or to take Scrooge's grand-nephews captive.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/275061-duck_tales.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-275061\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/275061-duck_tales.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-275061\"><img alt=\"Scrooge's \"pogo-jump\" in action\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/275061-duck_tales.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/275061-duck_tales.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Scrooge's \"pogo-jump\" in action</figcaption></figure><p>Players control Uncle Scrooge as he travels the world on his quest for treasure. Unlike many <a href=\"/platform/3055-1179/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1179\">platformers</a>, Scrooge takes damage upon any contact with an enemy regardless of his angle of approach. Players must instead rely on Scrooge's trusty <a href=\"/cane/3055-1714/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1714\">cane</a> which can be used to \"<a href=\"/pogo-stick/3055-2035/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2035\">pogo-jump</a>\" onto enemies' heads; this also increases the height of Scrooge's jump, allowing players to reach higher areas. The cane can be used to collect items and treasure locked up inside of treasure chests scattered around the world; it can also be swung like a <a href=\"/golf-club/3055-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-475\">golf club</a> to destroy obstacles or knock objects into enemies at range. Scrooge can even use his impressive pogo-jumping ablities to traverse deadly <a href=\"/spikes/3055-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-183\">spikes</a> and other hazards, preserving his tender webbed feet as his cane does all the work.</p><p>Scrooge can normally take up to three hits before losing a <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">life</a>. However, players can discover two hidden health upgrades in the Himalayas and Transylvania, potentially increasing Scrooge's <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">HP</a> to a total of five. DuckTales does not feature <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continues</a> or a <a href=\"/save-point/3015-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-51\">save</a> system; players must complete the entire game in a single session without depleting their stock of extra lives in order to reach the end.</p><h4>Items</h4><ul><li><strong>Small Diamond</strong>: Worth $2,000.</li><li><strong>Large Diamond</strong>: Worth $10,000.</li><li><strong>Red Diamond</strong>: Worth $50,000.</li><li><strong>Magic Coin</strong>: Grants Scrooge <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility</a>.</li><li><a href=\"/ice-cream/3055-1683/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1683\"><strong>Ice Cream</strong></a>: Restores one point of <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a>.</li><li><a href=\"/cake/3055-56/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-56\"><strong>Cake</strong></a>: Fully restores Scrooge's health.</li><li><strong>Scrooge Doll</strong>: Gives players an <a href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\">extra life</a>.</li><li><a href=\"/skeleton-key/3055-4557/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4557\"><strong>Skeleton Key</strong></a>: Grants access to the African Mines.</li><li><strong>UFO Key</strong>: Allows Scrooge to explore the UFO's restricted area.</li><li><strong>Remote Control</strong>: Used to call GizmoDuck near the Moon's boss room.</li></ul><h2>Stages</h2><p>DuckTales features five stages which can be played in any order, each with their own distinct music, enemies and graphical tileset.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"/amazon/3035-2844/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2844\">The Amazon</a></strong>: Scrooge blazes a trail through thick Amazonian jungle to reach an ancient temple containing the \"Sceptre of the Incan King\". Unfortunately, the temple is also riddled with traps and guarded by a <a href=\"/golem/3015-2538/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2538\">living stone idol</a>.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/transylvania/3035-941/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-941\">Transylvania</a></strong>: Magical mirrors <a href=\"/teleporter/3055-348/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-348\">teleport</a> Scrooge between sections of Count Dracula Duck's decrepit haunted castle.

The PC version, released a year later, replaced the use of still images for cutscenes with rendered animated cutscenes (and voiceovers). The game features an orchestral soundtrack, using both <a href=\"/john-williams/3040-1371/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1371\"> John Williams</a>'s iconic themes from the original trilogy and themes from the officially licensed soundtrack (created by composer <a href=\"/joel-mcneely/3040-35522/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-35522\"> Joel McNeely</a>).</p><h2>Gameplay </h2><p>Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire tackles many different forms of gameplay. These include third-person shooter/platforming levels, maintaining turrets on his ship (the Outrider) in an <a href=\"/on-rails/3015-169/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-169\"> on-rails</a> sequence, and total-control vehicle levels. Only the final level switches between different forms of gameplay mid-game.</p><h3>Shooter/Platforming Levels</h3><p>In most levels, the player controls Dash Rendar himself, running around and gunning stormtroppers, droids, and other enemies. The player can choose between third-person and limited first-person views. Dash uses a variety of weapons (though primarily his Laser Blaster, which has infinite ammo), including seeker missiles, flamethrowers, pulse cannons, stunners, and disruptors. In later levels, Dash obtains a rechargable <a href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6\"> jetpack</a>, which helps him fly over difficult platforming areas.</p><p>The Shooter/Platforming levels and the Swoop Bike level contain \"challenge points\" which are scattered throughout the level, seen in the form of a rotating chrome <a href=\"/\"> Rebel Alliance</a> emblem. These are often put in hard-to-reach areas, encouraging the player to explore the vast levels. Collecting all of them in certain difficulty levels will allow certain codes and privileges to be triggered, including gaining all weapons and invincibility, changing to an <a href=\"/x-wing/3055-345/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-345\"> X-Wing</a> or <a href=\"/tie-fighter/3055-675/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-675\"> TIE Fighter</a> in the final level, and allowing <a href=\"/wampa/3015-4961/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4961\"> wampas</a> to fight for you in the second level.</p><h3>On-Rails Turret Levels</h3><p>In some levels, the Outrider is piloted by Dash's robotic co-pilot, <a href=\"/leebo/3005-3256/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3256\"> Leebo</a>, as Dash maintains the ship's guns. Hazards, such as asteroids and enemy ships, must be blasted before they damage the ship.</p><h3>Flight Levels </h3><p>There are three levels in which Dash maintains full control of a vehicle: the beginning of the game (where he pilots a <a href=\"/t-47-airspeeder/3055-876/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-876\"> Snowspeeder</a>), the middle of the game (where he controls a Swoop Bike), and the end of the game (where he pilots the Outrider).</p><h2>Levels</h2><h3>Part I - The Battle of Hoth</h3><ul><li><b>Battle of Hoth</b> - Dash arrives on <a href=\"/hoth/3035-291/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-291\">Hoth</a> with a shipment to the rebels, and Han Solo convinces him to join <a href=\"/rogue-squadron/3015-1229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1229\"> Rogue Squadron</a>.

These vehicles, in order of appearance, are:</p><ul><li><b>The Slug Mariner</b>, a submarine that fires bombs and torpedoes.</li><li><b>The Elephant Slug</b>, a huge mechanized elephant equipped with a mini-gun.</li><li><b>The Ostrich Slug</b>, which is noted for it's speed and jumping abilities.</li><li><b>The Rebel Armor</b>, a vehicle produced by Rebel and equipped with a heavy machine gun, grenade launchers, and a melee attack.</li><li><b>The Astro Slug</b>, a space vehicle which can be used by the player near the end of the game. It is capable of firing rockets.</li></ul><h2>Missions</h2><h3>Mission 1</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-887445\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-887445\"><img alt=\"Marco, relaxing at home.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg 500w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6844/887445-metal_slug_3_other_boss.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Marco, relaxing at home.</figcaption></figure><p>The first mission puts you on an island, where crabs reign supreme.

What's there? Zombies, of course. Getting hit with the zombies' projectile bile turns you into a zombie, leaving you invincible against normal bullets, but another zombie hit means death. The boss of this place is a group of floating aliens and their glowy ship thing, once they're taken out.</p><h3>Mission 3</h3><p>While the first half of this mission is underwater, the other half- you know- isn't. Blow up submarines and SCUBA divers throughout the first half, and soldiers throughout the second. The boss here is a big ol' robot with laser eyes and a chest full of missiles.</p><h3>Mission 4</h3><p>Immediately after arriving in this desert, you are given a camel to ride. Appreciate him. Fight through waves of soldiers, helicopters and metal slugs for a while, then man-eating plants or mummies- depending on the path you choose. The boss here is... Well, I'm not sure. A floating alien-robot head? He has a beam that will turn you into gold, so try to avoid that.</p><h3>Final Mission</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920571\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920571\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg 800w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920571-xdk006_image24.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>The first part of this mission is played as a horizontal shooter in the style of <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\"><i>Gradius</i></a>, which culminates in a boss fight against <a href=\"/allen-oneil/3005-15040/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15040\">Allen O'Neil</a>.

data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> version was released as Probotector) is a 1987 video game developed and published by <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a>. The player controls a large, muscular soldier as he battles his way through waves of foes. Most of its popularity is credited to its two player co-op mode, a rarity at the time. While the arcade version was popular, the series really began to take off when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. Since then, the game has been ported to numerous systems and has had many sequels.</p><p>The game's music was composed by <a href=\"/hidenori-maezawa/3040-48451/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48451\">Hidenori Maezawa</a> and <a href=\"/kyouhei-sada/3040-48452/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48452\">Kyouhei Sada</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331863\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331863\"><img alt=\"A rare calm moment.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg 1024w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A rare calm moment.</figcaption></figure><p>The goal of the game is to traverse several <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling</a> levels. Equipped with a default <a href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-608\">machine gun</a>, the player has to repeatedly tap the button to fire, something that is changed in the game <a href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3016\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>. Unlike many other games at the time, the player can still fire while jumping. Other weapons can be collected as well by firing upon flying machines that appear in the level. Other weapons included are a machine gun, a laser, a flame thrower and the spread shot. The player can also pick up a <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power up</a> that enables the player to shoot faster.</p><p>There are two different types of levels. First, there is the traditional side-scrolling level, but the second is a <a href=\"/third-person-perspective/3015-464/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person</a> shooter. In the third-person shooter levels, the player must explore several rooms in which the player must destroy enemies coming into the room, and destroy the cannons within the room. After defeating all of the rooms a boss is faced. A boss's weak point is often identified by a flashing animation. Guns that available in the side-scrolling level are also available in the third-person levels.</p><h3>Guns</h3><p>While Konami never gave official names to the various guns &amp; power-ups, the community at large has come up with commonly accepted names for them:</p><ul><li><b>~=M=~ : Machine Gun</b> - The machine gun does more damage than the default rifle, which is indicated by its slightly larger bullets. The rate of fire remains the same as the default rifle.</li><li><b>~=S=~ : Spread</b> <b>Gun</b>- Possibly the most sought after power-up in the game. \"S\" replaces the default rifle with a machine gun that fires five bullets in a wide arc in front of the player. However, the gun comes with a limitation: players can only have ten bullets on the screen at the same time. So if the player presses the fire button if there are already seven bullets on the screen, the gun will only fire three more bullets. A common workaround for this problem is to get very close to the target before spamming the fire button. This tactic dramatically increases the gun's damage done per second.</li><li><b>~=F=~ : Flare Gun</b> - Shoots slow-moving balls of fire. Only four are allowed on screen at the same time.</li><li><b>~=L=~ : Laser Gun</b> - Each laser shot does 8 bullets worth of damage, but only one laser shot is allowed on the screen at a time. Firing again will cancel the existing laser on screen. This limits the gun's effectiveness in dealing with multiple enemies.</li></ul><h3>Power-Ups</h3><ul><li><b>~=R=~ : Rapid Fire</b> - Temporarily increases the rate of fire for whichever gun is equipped.</li><li><b>~=B=~ : Barrier -</b> Temporarily makes the player invulnerable to damage and gives them a deadly touch, where they can destroy any enemy by simply touching them.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p>Players take on the roles of <a href=\"/bill-rizer/3005-2584/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2584\">Bill Rizer</a> and <a href=\"/lance-bean/3005-2586/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2586\">Lance Bean</a> (codenamed Mad Dog and Scorpion) as they protect earth from an alien invasion known only as Red Falcon. The aliens are supposed to have arrived from a mysterious meteor sixty years previous to the events of the game.</p><h2>Secrets/Cheats</h2><h4>Konami Code</h4><p>While the <a href=\"/konami-code/3015-544/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-544\">Konami Code</a> debuted in <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\">Gradius</a>, it achieved legendary status with the incredibly difficult Contra. Using the code, players instantly receive 30 lives, making the game much easier. To activate the code, the player must press: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and then press Start (but Start can be pressed before the code is typed, as well).</p><h4>Steal Lives</h4><p>Another series staple. If one player dies in the two player cooperative mode and runs out of lives, that player can steal lives from the other player by holding down A and B simultaneously.</p><h4>Shoot while ducking (Base 1 &amp; 2)</h4><p>Normally, players can't shoot while ducking during these levels. But there is a workaround: Hold 'Up' on Controller 2 while ducking using Controller 1. This will result in the bullets being shot at a higher angle, even though the player is prone.</p><h4>Hard Difficulty / New Game</h4><p>After players beat the game and the credits are done rolling, they can start over with their remaining lives and the same weapon they finished the game with. The game is harder as a result of increased enemy count. The enemies themselves are stronger and shoot more often.</p><h4>Secret Ending (Japanese Version only)</h4><p>During the ending, hold down Start and Select before the credits start rolling and keep holding it until they are done. This results in a secret ending where Red Falcon vows his revenge.</p><h2>Regional Differences</h2><h3>Probotector</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224038\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224038\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>The European release of Contra was renamed and graphically modified. The arcade version had been released under the name Gryzor but with the same graphics. When the home NES version was going to be released in the PAL region they had to change some of the graphics due to German censorship policies. The name was changed to Probotector a mix of the words Robot and protector, the player characters were changed to robots as well as some enemies.</p><p>The Contra protagonists became robots RD008 and RC011, and almost all enemies received a mechanized makeover. European gamers generally remember fondly the Probotector games, as well as similarly-themed games such as <a href=\"/turrican/3030-15092/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15092\">Turrican</a>.</p><h3>Japanese and NTSC Differences</h3><p>In <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, Konami could improve some aspects of their videogames by utilizing chips inside the cartridges themselves (much like the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a>'s Super FX chip), thus overcoming some of the Famicom's limitations.</p><p>Contra received a full intro sequence, an extended ending sequence and small <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> in between levels with a short report and a <a href=\"/minimap/3015-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-185\">minimap</a> depicting where the player is headed next, as well as a large figure of the protagonist firing a gun or listening to a radio. Also, some of the background pieces gained animations, such as the waving trees in the Jungle and Snow Field, and the twitching organic landscape of The Alien's Lair.</p>", "deck": "A Konami

href=\"/contra/3030-4350/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4350\">Contra</a>. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean are sent on another campaign against the alien Red Falcon army, which has taken over a military base on Earth. It has gameplay is similar to the orignal, but features some upgraded graphics and top down levels which replace the <a href=\"/25d/3015-660/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-660\">pseudo-3D</a> <a href=\"/third-person-perspective/3015-464/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person</a> stages in the original game. Like the first game, it has a two player co-op mode.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>All of the weapons from the original Contra return here, though the Fire weapon has completely different behavior. Like the first game, weapons are obtained by shooting down pods which fly across the top of the screen at certain parts of the levels. In addition to the weapon powerups, the pods can drop a shield that provides a short period of invincibility and a bomb that destroys all enemies on the screen.</p><h2>Stages (NES Version)</h2><h3>Stage 1</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411692-19.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411692\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411692-19.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411692\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411692-19.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411692-19.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>The first level takes place in a war torn cityscape overrun by Red Falcon troops. Heavily featuring the new inclined surfaces introduced in Super C, the stage has enemies sniping and throwing bombs from rooftops and buildings in addition to the usual infantry swarms from either side of the screen. The first boss is a helicopter which fires from several guns mounted on its side. After making its first pass, it will fly low while enemy infantry jump out of the back.</p><h3>Stage 2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411696\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411696\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411696-23.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The second level is in a top down format. Stationary turrets and tanks with spread fire try to mow down our heroes, along with swarms of infantry. The boss is a tank with three mounted gunners and an extending electrical prod. It uses the prod to trap players against the bottom of the screen.</p><h3>Stage 3</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411698\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411698\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411698-25.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The third level takes place in a jungle. Infantry snipe and leap down from the treetops and camouflaged turrets pop out of the ground to kill unwary players. While crossing a shallow pond in the middle of the stage, Bill and Lance can duck under the water to avoid enemy fire.</p><p>There are two bosses in the Jungle stage. First is a spider tank that fires shots which weave up and down like the Wave Gun from the Metroid series. Players can jump on top of the boss and be safe from its attacks, but will have to jump down to the ground again to attack it. After destroying the tank and traversing a brief sequence where the ground collapses, a wall with rotating turrets will rise out of the ground. The glowing ball in the center is its weak spot, but the rotating guns can also be destroyed to make the battle easier.</p><h3>Stage 4</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411705\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411705\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411705-32.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The fourth stage is mostly vertical, with ledges and elevators taking you toward the top of an indoor complex while winged aliens jump down and wall turrets fire from above. The boss is a rack of laser beams that moves along a rail at the top of the screen. It will attempt to trap players against the sides of the arena with vertical waves of fire. Safe spots can be created by shooting out sections of the laser battery.</p><h3>Stage 5</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411710\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411710\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411710-37.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The fifth level is again mostly vertical, with Bill and Lance climbing a mountain peppered with turrets and plagued by boulders rolling down the inclined surface to crush them. Upon reaching the top, they encounter the entrance to the enemy base, with infantry coming out of doors in the walls and defensive guns popping up from the ground. The boss is an alien aircraft built out of human skulls. It drops animated skulls which skim along the ground from hatches on its side and fires spiked balls.</p><h3>Stage 6</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411717\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411717\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411717-44.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The sixth level is the second top down section. Hazards include giant spiders, huge alien mouths that pop out of the ground, creatures that circle our heroes, blocking fire while slowly moving in to attack, and gauntlets of holes in the walls that launch spiked balls.</p><p>This boss first appears as a line of faces which shoots a narrow stream of bullets. After destroying this creature, another boss emerges from its corpse. This second form shoots small fireballs at you while snake like creatures weave across the arena from the holes on the sides of the screen.</p><h3>Stage 7</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411725\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411725\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411725-52.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The seventh level has Bill and Lance moving down through the alien lair. The deadly enemies from the final level of the original Contra make an appearance here, emerging from pods like the ones see during the final boss fight of that game. There are also some large, slow moving purple creatures that take many shots to kill and spray bullets as they come closer and closer. The boss is a skeletal creature that looks similar to the third boss from the original Contra.</p><p> </p><h3>Stage 8</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411735\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411735\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31700/1411735-62.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The final level has players moving into the heart of the alien infested military complex. Souped up versions of the standard infantry dash in from the sides very quickly, while mouths in the background launch homing shots. A section towards the end has a ceiling that rises and falls, making traversing the pits in the area and avoiding the deadly homing orbs that appear difficult.</p><p>Emerging from the ground, the Final Boss appears as an alien skull atop a human female face with spiderlike legs. It's attacks can all be entirely avoided by running against its legs and firing at the head, which will damage it and destroy the shots it fires at you. After killing the gruesome thing, a helicopter flies Bill and Lance into the sunset while the credits roll.</p><h2>3DS Virtual Console Version</h2><p>Super C on the 3DS VC supports 2-Player via <a href=\"/single-card-download-play/3015-2407/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2407\">Download Play</a>.

The game was released in Japan in March 2008 as Contra: Dual Spirits.</p><p>Contra 4 ignores most of the games to bear the Contra name and takes things back to basics with a difficult, action-packed <a data-ref-id=\"3015-299\" href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299/\">side-scrolling</a> shooter, similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3016\" href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>. Weapons are acquired by grabbing <a data-ref-id=\"3015-700\" href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\">power-ups</a> dropped during battle and weapons can be upgraded by collecting multiple power-ups of the same type. A <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5\" href=\"/grapple/3055-5/\">grappling hook</a> feature puts both <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\">DS</a> screens into play by letting players grapple from one screen to the other.</p><p>Contra 4's story is set in the year 2638, two years after Contra III. In the game, an alien creature called Black Viper attacks Earth. As it continues attacking and killing Earth's inhabitants, four commandos are sent to the Galuga archipelago, where the Earth Federation has picked up strange readings that they believe are linked to Black Viper.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Contra 4 includes a number of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1414\" href=\"/unlockables/3015-1414/\">unlockable</a> characters from older entries in the series, including Jimbo, Sully, Lucia, Sheena Etranzi and even Probotector, who is the character that represents the series in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\">Europe</a>.

A button is obsolete).</p><p><b>Normal</b> (5 lives, 4 continues, 9 stages, moderately quick bullets/enemies).</p><p><b>Hard</b> (3 lives, 3 continues, 9 stages, quick bullets/enemies).

Extremely weak, which is why one death can lead to another soon after (after death, players lose their selected weapon).</p><p>Crush - Missles with a very short range but ultimately deal heavy damage. Upgraded form is the same with a longer range and deals slightly more damage.</p><p>Flame - While version 1 is a poor boomerang, the only redeeming quality of which is that its better than Rapid, the upgraded version deals heavy damage and even deals splash damage after hitting enemies.</p><p>Homing - Relatively weak missles that seek after opponents one at a time, allowing players to lazily avoid aiming. Its upgraded form has 3 missles for ever shot.</p><p>Laser - Relatively fast and relatively strong, the laser cuts past enemies, its only problem being its think range. The upgraded form is stronger, faster, and wider.</p><p>Machine Guns - Fast and easily deals heavy damage in short amounts of time.

Some of the soundtracks were completely original, while others were remixed tunes of tracks from older Contras. The soundtrack is made up of 27 songs and 135 sound effects, all unlockable in 'Sound Test' mode, and was well received by most sources.</p><h2>Options</h2><p>In the options menu, you can turn off the voice effects or erase all data.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Contra 4 was generally well received. It has a 83% on Metacritic and 84% on Gamerankings. Sources generally found that its sole problem (other than difficulty, which some thought was refreshing while others felt it was unnecessary) was the area between the two screens, which was treated as though there was actually space the player could see. Overall, it was received as a good way to revive a franchise, even if others felt the system was outdated.</p>", "deck": "Contra 4 brings classic side-scrolling action to the DS as Earth is faced with a new menace, and four of Earth's strongest soldiers have been chosen to fight back on Galluga Island.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2243844-box_contra4.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2243844-box_contra4.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2243844-box_contra4.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2243844-box_contra4.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2243844-box_contra4.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2243844-box_contra4.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2243844-box_contra4.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/contra-4/3030-4237/", "name": "Contra 4", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-4237/", "number_of_user_reviews": 5, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/", "id": 33, "name": "CERO: B"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/", "abbreviation": "DS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/", "id": 52, "name": "Nintendo DS"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:48:31", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 4237, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": null}, "platform": "DS", "title": "Contra 4"}, {"duration": "1:25:00", "runner": "SwordofSeals", "data": {"original_release_date": "1997-10-31 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2015-01-04 10:29:06", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is the sequel to <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3030-7380/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7380\"> Crash Bandicoot</a>.

Upon lighting a match, he discovers a Master Crystal, which sets a new evil plot in his mind. Two years after this, Cortex consults his new right hand man, <a href=\"/dr-n-gin/3005-3329/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3329\"> Dr N.Gin</a> on the matter. N.Gin states that the Master Crystal is not nearly enough for their plan, and that they are going to need the twenty five Slave Crystals as well. Cortex acknowledges that there are no friends left on earth to aid them, so an enemy is needed. </p><p>On an errand to get some batteries for his sister's laptop, Crash is abducted by Cortex, who tells Crash that he is a changed man in dire need of the bandicoot's assistance. Cortex gets Crash to recover all twenty five Slave Crystals, whilst tricking him that it's for the good of the planet. Crash's sister, <a href=\"/coco-bandicoot/3005-1153/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1153\"> Coco</a>, and Cortex's ex-right hand man, <a href=\"/dr-n-brio/3005-3978/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3978\"> N. Brio</a>, realize that Cortex wants the Crystals to power a new Cortex Vortex, to achieve world domination. Coco and N. Brio try to warn Crash, who finds out just in time. With all twenty five Crystals in his possession, Crash confronts and beats Cortex once again. If the player has also obtained all of the Gems in the game, a bonus ending will play, where N. Brio uses the gems' power to destroy the Cortex Vortex for good. We see from the beginning of <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot-warped/3030-12909/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12909\"> Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped</a>, that this ending is the canonical one.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>While the core gameplay of platforming and smashing boxes remains the same, some drastic changes were brought into Crash 2, and they would become staples for the franchise. The most significant is the warp room system, which eradicated the map screen from the first game. When Crash is abducted, he is thrust into a warp room, in which the player can choose to play 5 levels in any order. If the player collects the crystal from each one, they are able to proceed to the next warp room after a boss fight. Some old faces return, such as Ripper Roo, and some new ones are added, such as Komodo Joe and Moe, as well as <a href=\"/tiny-tiger/3005-2038/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2038\"> Tiny the tiger</a>. After the game is completed, the player can revisit the levels and attempt to obtain all gems and gain the elusive 100%.</p><h3>Bonus Levels </h3><p>In each level, there is a bonus round. Crash does not lose lives when doing these and, unlike the first game, can repeat them as many times as the player wishes, as long as they do not finish them. Most bonus rounds involve the player having to think about how they will get all the boxes for the gem. </p><h2>New Items</h2><p>As well as the returning items such as Wumpa Fruit and <a href=\"/aku-aku/3005-1235/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1235\"> Aku Aku</a>, Crash Bandicoot 2 added a couple of extras to enhance gameplay. These are: </p><h3>The Nitro Crate</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15389/512123-31788532.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-512123\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15389/512123-31788532.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-512123\"><img alt=\"Nitro Crate\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15389/512123-31788532.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15389/512123-31788532.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></a><figcaption>Nitro Crate</figcaption></figure><p>Like the <a href=\"/tnt-crate/3055-1166/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1166\"> TNT crate</a>; however, this item would explode on impact, even if it were only touched by Crash. A green exclamation mark box will explode all nitro crates in the level, so getting the level's gem was still possible.</p><h3>The Crystal</h3><p>In the original Crash Bandicoot, the way the player would progress through the levels would be completely linear. In Crash Bandicoot 2, however, Crash was given five levels at a time to tackle, in what ever order the player wished. To signify that a level was complete, the player would bring a crystal back from it, which was always placed rather blatantly in the level. If the player dodged the crystal, but made it through the level, then the level was still regarded as incomplete. Crystals are given context in the plot as the reason why Crash is on his adventure this time round.</p><h2>Structure</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659713\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2216666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659713\"><img alt=\"Crash 2 Map, click to enlarge\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\" data-width=\"523\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg 523w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crash 2 Map, click to enlarge\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3357/659713-crash2map.jpg 523w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\" data-width=\"523\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Crash 2 Map, click to enlarge</figcaption></figure><p>Using the Warp room system meant that the general amount of areas in the game rose from the original, There were now five Warp Rooms that Crash had to make his way through in order to complete the game, each containing five levels. These levels were still based around the <a href=\"/n-sanity-island/3035-137/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-137\"> three islands</a> of the first game but environmental changes had altered the landscape drastically and the player never knew where they where on each island in a level. Naughty Dog released a map like poster to clarify general level whereabouts, pictured right.</p><h3> </h3><p> </p><h2>The First Warp Room</h2><p>Set on the first of the three islands, this warp room sets up the basic play of the game easing the player into the gameplay.</p><h3>Levels</h3><ul><li><b>Turtle Woods- </b>A basic forest level where Crash needs to find the Crystal in the rainy Jungle.</li><li><b>Snow Go- </b>The first Snow level, contains some side scrolling as do other snow levels in the game.</li><li><b>Hang Eight- </b>A water level where crash must make his way upstream on platforms without drowning.</li><li><b>The Pits-</b> Another forest level focus on falling in pits and killing all the rats inside to continue.</li><li><b>Crash Dash- </b>The first 'boulder chase' level of Crash 2 this time from a giant snowball.</li></ul><h3>Warp Room End Boss - Ripper Roo</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659757\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6821705426357\" data-width=\"129\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 129px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659757\"><img alt=\"Dr. Roo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px\" data-width=\"129\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg 129w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dr. Roo\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/659757-chripperbash.jpg 129w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px\" data-width=\"129\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dr. Roo</figcaption></figure><p>Ripper Roo is the one returning boss from the first game excluding Dr. Cortex himself. We find Ripper Roo supposedly in the same spot he was in the original, however he has turned his waterfall den into a library. Roo also appears differently in this game, wearing a top hat and a bow tie, this earned him his other name Dr. Roo. Crash must fight Ripper Roo on a grid where the squares get filled with TNT depending on where Roo bounces, the explosion will eventually catch up with Roo and hit him causing him to set Nitro squares that crash can't step on. If Crash can dodge both TNT and Nitro explosions he has a chance to hit Roo. This game further reinforces the idea that Ripper Roo isn't working for Cortex as at this point Cortex is not wanting him to hand over the crystals to a minion, he even warns Crash of 'enemies' before proceeding. This means that Ripper Roo was either working for the side of good, or he was just tinkering with the warp room system.</p><h2>The Second Warp Room</h2><p>Set on the Second Island which has frozen over since the first game.</p><h3>Levels</h3><ul><li><b>Snow Biz- </b>The second snow level, structured similarly to Snow Go.</li><li><b>Air Crash- </b>Another water level which introduces the Surfer, a motorized board for Crash to use when crossing large bodies of water.(contains secret level entrance).</li><li><b>Bear It- </b>The first animal ride level of the game, Crash is on a Polar bear cub who is constantly running.

The boss fight includes Crash having to dodge Komodo Joe's spinning attack until he gets dizzy, after this Crash can spin him into Komodo Moe and damage both of them. Komodo Moe will also throw knives at Crash.</p><h2>The Third Warp Room</h2><p>This warp room is located in the lower half of the third island, where the Cortex Power plant on once was, Crash is paddling in water amongst the pipes here.</p><h3>Levels</h3><ul><li><b>Plant Food- </b>Another water level with an emphasis on large Piranha plants.</li><li><b>Sewer Or Later- </b>The second Sewer level.</li><li><b>Bear Down- </b>The second animal ride level.(contains secret level entrance).</li><li><b>Road To Ruin- </b>The first lost city ruins level.

By this time crash has had time to think about what Cortex's real motives are and refuses to give Tiny the crystals. Tiny is another one of Cortex's mutant army and is incredibly loyal to his master, he is also portrayed as being all brawn and no brain. The boss fight happens in Cortex's Space Station on platforms above an enormous drop. The aim of the boss fight is to avoid Tiny Tiger and wait until some platforms warn that they are going to fall, Crash must lure Tiny into falling by guiding him toward falling platforms whilst minding not to fall himself. </p><h2>The Fourth Warp Room</h2><p>This warp room is further up the third island in an abandoned mine.</p><h3>Levels</h3><ul><li><b>Hangin' Out - </b>Sewer level were sewage workers give Crash grief.</li><li><b>Diggin' It - </b>An outdoor level where Crash must avoid bee's by burrowing into the ground.</li><li><b>Cold Hard Crash- </b>Last of the ice levels.</li><li><b>Ruination- A</b>nother lost city ruins level that adds monkeys to the list of obstacles.</li><li><b>Bee-Having- </b>Another outdoor burrowing level, strange Mayan Totems will attempt to destroy crash here.</li></ul><h3>Warp Room End Boss - Dr. N.

The player can drive around this area to reach different parts of the game.</p><p>The game was released for the original PlayStation in 1999 and was later made available for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable as part of the \"<a href=\"/psone-classics/3015-8405/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8405\">PSone Classics</a>\" series on the <a href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\">PlayStation Network</a> store.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Crash Team Racing opens with a <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene</a> showing each of the characters in the world of <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3025-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-116\">Crash Bandicoot</a> enjoying what they are up to when suddenly they are teleported away. They are all shocked to see themselves gathered in one area, friend and foe alike. Before they have a chance to start attacking each other, a giant screen lights up in front of them, an alien by the name of <a href=\"/nitros-oxide/3005-4075/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4075\">Nitros Oxide</a> declares that he wants to race the best driver in this world and that if he, Nitros Oxide, wins he will turn the world into a giant parking lot. He says that he doesn't know who the best racer in the land is so he wants everyone to race against each other and he will challenge the winner. Once the player collects of all the Time Relics, CTR Tokens and <a href=\"/crystal/3055-445/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-445\">Crystals</a>, Oxide admits defeat and returns to his home planet.</p><h2>Adventure</h2><p>Adventure mode is the single-player story mode of the game. At the beginning the player chooses one character from the roster and enters an open-world environment. From here the player can access races through <a href=\"/warp-zone/3015-804/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-804\">warp zones</a> similar to those seen in <a href=\"/crash-bandicoot-warped/3030-12909/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12909\">Crash Bandicoot 3</a>. After the player has finished first in a race they can either go and play unlocked levels or complete Time Trial races or CTR races. Time Trial has the player attempt three <a href=\"/laps/3015-1202/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1202\">laps</a> round the track in a short specific time, the only way to achieve these is to master the quickest paths and smash time crates which stop the counter. In CTR races the player has to collect CTR tokens scattered around the level whilst still completing the race in first place. Finally the other way to get CTR tokens in through challenges in Adventure, the player must speed around the battle levels and collect crystals under a certain time limit. Completing races continues the plot of the game and unlocks more races and environments. After a set amount of races have been completed Boss Races become available from famous <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a> in the Crash franchise. Once beaten the Bosses open new environments for the player with new warp zones and challenges. While the player does not need to complete Time Trials and CTR token races they are used to unlock additional characters later in the game.</p><h3>Bosses</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367018\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74857142857143\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367018\"><img alt=\"The game in action\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-width=\"350\"></a><figcaption>The game in action</figcaption></figure><p>The following are the boss racers the player will encounter in the Adventure Mode;</p><ul><li><a href=\"/ripper-roo/3005-12156/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12156\">Ripper Roo</a></li><li><a href=\"/papu-papu/3005-11696/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11696\">Papu Papu</a></li><li><a href=\"/komodo-joe/3005-14668/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14668\">Komodo Joe</a></li><li><a href=\"/pinstripe/3005-3980/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3980\">Pinstripe</a></li><li><a href=\"/nitros-oxide/3005-4075/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4075\">Nitrous Oxide</a></li></ul><h3>Areas</h3><p>The game is spilt up into different five different areas where races are unlocked and played:</p><ul><li><b>N.Sanity Beach</b></li></ul><p>Crash Cove, Roo's Tubes, Mystery Caves and Sewer Speedway.</p><ul><li><b>The Lost Ruins</b></li></ul><p>Coco Park, Tiger Temple, Papu's Pyramid and Dingo Canyon.</p><ul><li><b>Glacier Park</b></li></ul><p>Blizzard Bluff, Dragon Mines, Polar Pass and Tiny Arena.</p><ul><li><b>The Citadel</b></li></ul><p>N.

The player will get an increase in their top speed and it will modify any power-ups to make them stronger e.g. A <a href=\"/tnt-crate/3055-1166/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1166\">TNT crate</a> will become a <a href=\"/nitro-crate/3055-1167/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1167\">Nitro crate</a>. The player can collect wumpa fruit by smashing spring box crates and also pick up loose wumpa fruit scattered around the track. If the player has wumpa fruit and are hit by an enemy racer or if they fall off the track the number of wumpa fruit they have will decrease.</p><p><b>Uka Uka/Aku Aku</b> - The Voodoo mask provides three different effects to the player for a limited time. A mask will spin around the player and they will receive a noticeable increase in speed, invulnerability to other racer's power ups and the player can also hit other racers to cause them to spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer. Good characters will receive the <a href=\"/aku-aku/3005-1235/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1235\">Aku Aku</a> mask and bad characters will get the <a href=\"/uka-uka/3005-1377/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1377\">Uka Uka</a> mask, there is no gameplay difference between the masks.</p><p><b>Green and Red Bottles</b> - Green bottles can be dropped behind the player or can be fired forward. If a racer hits a green bottle they will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a red bottle is obtained instead. The red bottle has a similar effect to the green bottle but it also forms a raincloud over the player that hits it. The player is slowed down and also loses the ability to hop. Red and green bottles can also be used to deflect incoming attacks.</p><p><b>Homing Missiles</b> - <a href=\"/homing-missile/3055-857/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-857\">Homing missiles</a> will lock on to the nearest racer in front when fired. They will follow racers until they hit their target but can be avoided by obstructing their path with track terrain or using a TNT/Nitro crate to destroy them. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause racers to spin out for longer. A triple version of this power up is also available where the racer gets three <a href=\"/rocket/3055-713/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-713\">rockets</a> instead of one from a single pick-up.</p><p><b>TNT and Nitro Crates</b> - A TNT crate can be dropped behind the player's cart to obstruct other racers. If a racer hits a TNT crate it will land on their head and countdown. The racer has three seconds to shake the TNT off before it explodes by hopping up and down. If caught in the TNT blast radius racers will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a TNT crate becomes a Nitro crate. Nitro crates have the same effect except they lack the delay and explode on contact. TNT/Nitro crates can be used to block incoming attacks.</p><p><b>Bowling Balls</b> - <a href=\"/bowling-ball/3055-746/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-746\">Bowling balls</a> can be fired forwards or backwards. They travel in a straight line and explode on contact with either racers or terrain. They cause racers to spin out when hit and they can also be detonated by pressing circle again after they have been released. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause the racer to spin out for longer. A triple power up is also available where the racer gets three bowling balls instead of one.</p><p><b>Warp Orb</b> - Once it has been fired, a warp orb will travel the course ahead of the player's cart and make anyone in the vicinity spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit, it lasts longer.</p><p><b>Green and Blue Shields -</b> Green shields when activated will protect the player's cart from a single attack or will eventually fade away if they are not hit. The player can also fire the shield ahead of them like a bowling ball. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the shield turns blue and will last longer.</p><p><b>Timer</b> - When activated it will slow down all other racers to crawling speed for a short time. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer.</p><p><b>Turbo</b> - A <a href=\"/turbo/3055-1209/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1209\">turbo</a> will give the player a prolonged burst of speed like the boost gained from power sliding. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the boost lasts for longer.</p><h2>Turbo</h2><p>As well as the turbo gained from the power up turbo, boost can also be gained from a few different techniques:</p><p><b>Turbo Start -</b> At the beginning of each race it is possible to gain a <a href=\"/boost/3015-461/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-461\">boost</a> right from the go by timing acceleration with the lights. If the acceleration is timed to the half-way point between the last red light and the green it will result in an instant boost.</p><p><b>Power-sliding Turbos</b> - Pressing and holding the R1 button around a corner will make the player perform a <a href=\"/powerslide/3030-16728/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16728\">powerslide</a>. When the smoke from the exhaust turns black the player can activate a small turbo by pressing the L1 button. They can do three boosts in one powerslide at a time. This technique is essential to getting the best times on tracks.</p><p><b>Jump Turbos</b> - Jump turbos are performed by hopping off the top of a ramp, hump or ridge and then landing. The boost kicks in once the player lands. The longer they are in the air the more boost they get when they land. Jumping and landing on flat ground is not enough to enact the jump boost.</p><h2>Spyro 2 Demo</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219310\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0840336134454\" data-width=\"238\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219310\"><img alt=\"Eager players got an early look at Spyro 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg 238w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eager players got an early look at Spyro 2\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eager players got an early look at Spyro 2</figcaption></figure><p>On the main menu screen, if the player types in the cheat code, \"Hold L1 R1 and press Down, Circle, Triangle, Triangle, Right\" they will unlock a <a href=\"/spyro-2-riptos-rage/3030-1563/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1563\">Spyro the Dragon 2: Gateway to Glimmer</a> demo.

This tutorial section starts you off on a mission where Sly must attempt to steal a file on the Fiendish Five from the Interpol headquarters in <a href=\"/paris/3035-487/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-487\">Paris</a>, France.</p><p>After stealing the file, he confronts <a href=\"/carmelita-fox/3005-1111/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1111\">Carmelita Fox</a>, a police vixen who has apparently been on Sly's trail for a while (there's little dialogue tidbits here and they're hinting at some back story between the two).</p><p>After escaping, a cut scene reveals Sly's history with the Five, and sets up the story for the rest of the game. Sly comes from a long line of master thieves who only steal from criminals. His family's most prized possession is the Thievius Raccoonus, a mysterious book that has been handed down in the family through centuries, detailing each of their master thief \"moves.\" This book eventually leads to a lot of trouble for Sly, who when he was just a little raccoon lad \"balancing on his fathers knee,\" had to resort to hiding in a closet while the Fiendish Five came to his door, overpowered his father, and killed his family in order to steal the book.</p><p>After ransacking the house looking for the book, the gang ripped the it into five pieces, each taking a piece back to their lairs so the coopers could never rise to steal from them again.</p><p>Sly was then dumped off at an orphanage where he met his two best friends, and partners in crime: Bentley, a turtle with a plan, and the brains of the operation, and Murray, a hippo, who's the muscle and wheel man of the group. They vow to track down the Fiendish Five and get back the Thievius Raccoonus.</p><p>To do this, Sly must complete a stage for each member of the Fiendish Five, which is made up of a number of levels. To move on he must collect the <a href=\"/key/3055-105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-105\">key</a> at the end of each level, which can be used later to unlock new sections, and eventually open the way to the final <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a>.</p><h3>The Fiendish Five (in order of appearance)</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/sir-raleigh/3005-3142/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3142\">Sir Raleigh</a> - A frog and chief mechanic, Sir Raleigh grew bored of his luxurious life and decided to try his hand at pirating.</li><li><a href=\"/muggshot/3005-3092/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3092\">Muggshot</a> - A big bulldog bruiser, who, after seeing his first gangster film at the theater, decided that a life of crime was the life for him. Though he used to be a scrawny little mutt, he pumped up and became the muscle of the Fiendish Five.</li><li><a href=\"/mz-ruby/3005-3105/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3105\">Mz. Ruby</a> - A swamp gator and voodoo priestess, the chief paranormal expert.</li><li><a href=\"/panda-king/3005-3075/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3075\">Panda King</a> - Demolitions expert, Panda King grew up poor on the mean streets of China. Every night he saw the nobles shoot off their fireworks, but when he tried to design his own he was shunned for his shabby clothing. Feeling bitter, he turned to crime.</li><li><a href=\"/clockwerk/3005-3083/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3083\">Clockwerk</a> - A shadowy figure, it is discovered that he has kept himself alive for thousands of years through a mixture of magic and science.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Mechanics</h3><p>Sly Cooper's combat system is simple; you use the X button to jump (tap again while in the air to <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump</a>), the square button to attack, the triangle button to use any unlocked abilities (you get these by breaking all the hidden clue bottles in each level and unlocking the levels safe), and the circle button to trigger actions (such as running along a tight rope or walking on a ledge). Some of these actions can only be triggered near blue sparks that appear floating around the levels, described as a thieving opportunity in the game, which only a raccoon master thief can see.</p><p>The damage system in Sly Cooper is very much like the <a href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\"><i>Mario</i></a> games, in that all your attacks are one hit kills (except when your going after a boss, which involves some sort of puzzle). The same goes for you; if you get hit you're dead. However, you can pick up lucky horseshoes scattered around the levels, which serves as a sort of health bar, giving you a second chance after being hit; this saves you from losing a life. When you collect a lucky horseshoe it will appear on your back, attached to your backpack. The color of the horseshoe (silver or gold) indicates how many you have (silver being 1, gold being 2), and thus how many chances you have left to be hit without dying.</p><p>In addition to combat, the game includes some light <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> elements, like tip-toeing up behind guards to get a sneak attack, or avoiding motion sensors so as to not set off an alarm, which <a href=\"/alert/3015-1606/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1606\">alert</a> nearby guards to your position and/or set off <a href=\"/traps/3015-609/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-609\">traps</a>.</p><h3>The Load Out</h3><p>The main weapon you use throughout the game is Sly's <a href=\"/cane/3055-1714/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1714\">cane</a>, which is just your average blunt object, though it is stylish in its appearance. There are also many other cool weapons you use periodically throughout the campaign including <a href=\"/turret/3055-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-43\">turrets</a>, car-mounted battering rams, Carmelita's Shock <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">Pistol</a>, and <a href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6\">jet pack</a>-mounted missiles.</p><h3>Variety</h3><p>Platforming and combat may take center stage in Sly Cooper, but numerous gameplay genres are also exhibited by Sly and his partners throughout the game. These include multiple <a href=\"/dual-joystick-shooter/3015-1627/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1627\">dual-joystick shooting</a>, <a href=\"/lap-racing/3015-2626/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2626\">lap racing</a>, and <a href=\"/rail-shooter/3015-320/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-320\">rail shooting</a> sequences, as well as a boss battle that features <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=19/\">rhythm</a> gameplay.</p>", "deck": "Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is a platformer that sees Sly Cooper and his gang on a mission to defeat the five criminals that killed Sly's family and reclaim the pages of the Thievius Raccoonus, a book of family thieving techniques compiled by generations of the Cooper family.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2276072-box_scattr.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2276072-box_scattr.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2276072-box_scattr.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2276072-box_scattr.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2276072-box_scattr.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2276072-box_scattr.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2276072-box_scattr.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sly-cooper-and-the-thievius-raccoonus/3030-15353/", "name": "Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-15353/", "number_of_user_reviews": 4, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/", "abbreviation": "PS2", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/", "id": 19, "name": "PlayStation 2"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/", "abbreviation": "PS3N", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/", "id": 88, "name": "PlayStation Network (PS3)"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:20:30", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 15353, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "Sly Cooper"}, "platform": "PS2", "title": "Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus"}, {"duration": "0:40:00", "runner": "headstrong1290", "data": {"original_release_date": "2001-12-04 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2014-07-23 09:42:50", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is the first game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-366\" href=\"/jak-daxter/3025-366/\">Jak and Daxter franchise</a>.

The continent is geographically diverse to the extreme, full of both lava pits and icy mountains, thick forests and sprawling beaches. Curiously, the locations themselves are named, but the continent itself isn't, but that's the least of the mysteries surrounding this universe as it is littered with the remnants of a once great race of beings known only as the Precursors.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>While primarily an open world 3D platformer, Jak and Daxter has some limited combat, which is again almost identical to that of the Crash Bandicoot games. Jak is capable of various attacks and moves, including a long punch, spinning kick, jump uppercut, downward smash, roll, double jump, long jump and high jump, which can be used to defeat enemies, activate secrets and speedily traverse terrain. Damage can be taken from enemies, falling long distances or touching dangerous surfaces, each event taking a bar of life or potentially vaporizing Jak entirely.</p><p>The main objective to proceed in Jak and Daxter is to collect <a data-ref-id=\"3055-806\" href=\"/power-cell/3055-806/\">Power cells</a>, which are used to power vehicles and technology which provide (relatively) safe passage to the next major area. These can be found scattered across the landscape (usually as rewards for challenging platforming or combat situations), bought from various people Jak encounters on his journeys or acquired by completing quests</p><p>(sometimes including minigames) for these same people. The main currency in Jak and Daxter are <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3680\" href=\"/precursor-orb/3055-3680/\">Precursor Orbs</a>, which litter the landscape. In every area, there are 7 strong boxes which Jak can break to release scout flies, the last of which yields a power cell.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/204350-18700_10_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204350\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/204350-18700_10_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204350\"><img alt=\"Jak riding the Zoomer\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/204350-18700_10_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/204350-18700_10_2.jpg 400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/204350-18700_10_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jak riding the Zoomer</figcaption></figure><p>A major game mechanic comes in the form of colored energy, called <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1621\" href=\"/eco/3015-1621/\">Eco</a>. In total, there are six types of Eco in the game: Green, which replenishes life; Blue, which enhances speed, attracts nearby collectibles and activates Precursor technology; Red, which enhances melee combat power; Yellow, which gives a ranged burst of energy attack; Dark, which deals damage to or kills Jak instantly; and White, which is only encountered at the end of the game as the combination of the first four Eco types. The effects of blue, red and yellow Eco dissipate at a steady rate, which adds a timed element to many challenges that feature or require their use. Eco can be collected in hovering globules of small or large size, but only Eco vents give constant and complete filling of the Eco meter as long as you stand on them. Jak can only use a single type of Eco at a time, so collecting a different type will overwrite the current one.</p><p>Vehicle sections separate major sections of the game world, usually involving a timed mechanic (including overheating from lava and chasing down demolition-minded enemys), and there are a few major boss battles.</p><h2>Comic Relief</h2><p>Besides many comedic interactions and commentary, Jak and Daxter has a couple fairly unique methods of comic relief:</p><p>Whenever the duo acquires a new power cell, it is accompanied by a success dance or tableau cutscene and accordingly triumphant music. Also, whenever Jak keels over from losing all his life (and it makes sense that Daxter might not be out of commission as well), there is a short randomly chosen cutscene. These are viewed from Jak's incapacitated perspective of Daxter standing on his chest and making wisecracks at the expense of his buddy (and the player), including insulting his breath, requesting his change and, as long as he's down there, a foot massage.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Jak and Daxter, two young elfin rascals, secretly sail off to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2869\" href=\"/misty-island/3035-2869/\">Misty Island</a> against the wishes of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2253\" href=\"/samos/3005-2253/\">Samos</a> the Sage and discover a sinister gathering of evil Lurkers creatures addressed a pair of floating villains. The protagonists attempt to sneak away, but they are soon discovered by a lone Lurker who attacks them. Jak hurls a barrel of Eco at the Lurker which destroys it and sends Daxter flying into a vat of Dark Eco. He is spat out again as a loudmouthed ottsel (otter weasel). When they return to Samos for help returning Daxter to his original form he chides them harshly and explains that they must travel far, far north to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9820\" href=\"/gol-acheron/3005-9820/\">Gol Acheron</a>, who might be able to help them. A firey canyon stands in the way, which can only be traversed by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3416\" href=\"/keira/3005-3416/\">Keira</a>'s Zoomer with a heat shield upgrade made possible with power cells.</p><p>After successfully passing through the canyon, Jak and Daxter find the next town, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-646\" href=\"/rock-village/3035-646/\">Rock Village</a>, under siege by a giant cyborg lurker named Klaww and the Blue Sage, the patron sage of the town, mysteriously missing, his laboratory a mess. After gathering more power cells, a flaming boulder blocking the path to the monster can be dislodged with an anti-gravity device, and the duo proceed via Zoomer through a mountain pass to reach the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-647\" href=\"/volcanic-crater/3035-647/\">Volcanic Crater</a>.</p><p>Here, they find the Red Sage missing and his laboratory in similarly terrible shape. Gol Akuron and his sister, Maia Acheron, (whom we remember from the Lurker gathering) appear and explain how they have captured all the sages but Samos, and, in an effort to shape the world to their liking, plan to flood the world with the Dark Eco contained in the massive Percursor silos to the north. More power cells and another heat shield upgrade allow Keira's Zoomer to brave the Lava Tube, which leads to the Yellow Sage's lab.</p><p>When they arrive, Keira explains that her father has also been kidnapped. Jak and Daxter then venture into <a data-ref-id=\"3035-771\" href=\"/gol-and-maias-citadel/3035-771/\">Gol and Maia's Citadel</a>, where they learn the sages were being used to power the Percursor robot, which is powerful enough to open the silo. After freeing the sages, the two encounter Gol and Maia with a reworked Percursor robot atop the Dark Eco silo. Jak battles the robot, as its strikes open the silo further and further, and only with the help of all four sages combining their powers to create the fabled White Eco does he defeat it. Although Daxter realizes it would probably reverse his transformation, he decides saving the world is more important.</p><p>The Percursor robot containing Gol and Maia is disabled and crashes into the silo, which then seals itself again. Although this might kill them both, Samos is uncertain this is the case. The group's attention is directed toward a massive Percursor door, which requires 100 power cells before it opens, revealing some thing large shrouded in blinding light.

The story of <i>Going Commando</i> takes place a year after Ratchet and Clank first save the <a href=\"/solana-galaxy/3035-466/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-466\">Solana Galaxy</a> from <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek</a>. Now both Ratchet and Clank are hired by the Megacorp company to find a blue-fuzzball creature that was stolen from the company's lab. As Ratchet finds out about the thief's plans, he learns that the creature called the \"Protopet\" is dangerous monster that can destroyed the whole <a href=\"/bogon-galaxy/3035-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-469\">Bogon Galaxy</a>, now Ratchet and Clank must save the galaxy once again.</p><p>Ratchet &amp; Clank will explore the galaxy in a semi-linear fashion with an ever expanding selection of locations available from your ship's galaxy map. Apart from tighter movement and platforming with an increased focus on shooting, the gameplay formula is similar to the first game but with additions such as upgradable weapons (upgraded by continued use), customisable ships and armor, a fighting area with bolt rewards, space ship battles, and hacking minigames to unlock doors.</p><p>Familiar elements also return like hover racing events, skill points and a <a href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-150\">new game plus</a> mode called \"challenge mode\" which increases the difficulty but allows you to keep your current weapons and equipment, and even unlock more challenge mode exclusive items.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Upon defeating <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek</a>, Ratchet and Clank become galactic celebrities. Nearly a year passes when the duo are interviewed for <i>Behind The Hero</i>, a HoloVision documentary show. This grabs the attention of <a href=\"/abercrombie-fizzwidget/3005-22257/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22257\">Abercrombie Fizzwidget</a> (founder and CEO of <a href=\"/megacorp/3015-8226/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8226\">Megacorp</a>) who teleports them to a luxury apartment on Megopolis in the <a href=\"/bogon-galaxy/3035-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-469\">Bogon Galaxy</a>.</p><p>Fizzwidget's hologram requests their assistance in the recovery of a dangerous biological experiment (with the appearance of a cute, blue fuzzball) stolen by a mysterious masked mastermind. After the supplied commando training and equipment, Ratchet is sent to a flying laboratory on planet Aranos but thief makes a quick getaway with the experiment.</p><p>Ratchet and Clank chase the thief across several planets before encountering him on the frozen planet Siberius where he's defeated and the experiment is recovered. Upon returning to Fizzwidget at the desert planet Tabora, he \"accidentally\" ejects them from their ship, crash landing them onto the planet.</p><p>Here, they are confronted by the thief demanding the experiment however he trips and falls, ripping the mask off to reveal a female <a href=\"/lombax/3015-2641/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2641\">Lombax</a> named<a href=\"/angela-cross/3005-4598/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4598\"> Angela Cross</a>, a former Megacorp employee. She warns them that the experiment would doom the galaxy. On the planet Dobbo they realize her claims are true and attempt to warn Fizzwidget to destroy the experiment, but are unsuccessful. </p><p>It's revealed via an advertisement that the experiment (now named \"The <a href=\"/protopet/3005-11519/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11519\">Protopet</a>\") is being cloned and prepared for mass release. On planet Boldan they're captured and imprisoned by Thugs-4-Less, a mercenary company hired by Fizzwidget. However they're able to escape and rescue Angela before travelling to Megacorp HQ to destroy the Protopets. </p><p>They discover that disgraced superhero <a href=\"/captain-qwark/3005-1783/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1783\">Captain Qwark</a> had disguised himself as Fizzwidget and was behind the plan to release the Protopets in order to destroy them to \"save\" the galaxy and restore his reputation as a superhero. His plans are foiled when he attempts to use Angela's Helix-o-Morph gadget designed to repair the Protopets' aggression on the original experiment, however it malfunctions, mutating it into a giant monster that swallows him.</p><p>After defeating the giant Protopet, Angela and the real Fizzwidget arrive explaining that he'd been tied up in a closet for the duration of Qwark's takeover. The Protopet regurgitates Qwark and Angela flips the Helix-o-Morph's batteries in order to shrink it back to it's original size. She then amplifies the device using Megacorp's TV transponders to destroy all the Protopets in the galaxy.</p><p>Ratchet, Clank, Angela, and Clank's Infobot lover he had met earlier relax in Ratchet's apartment in Megapolis where Angela reveals that Qwark is now employed as a Megacorp test subject.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p><i>Going Commando</i> takes place in the Bogon Galaxy, a neighboring galaxy to Solana.

Star is a side-scrolling platformer developed by <a href=\"/hal-laboratory-inc/3010-753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-753\">HAL Laboratory</a> and originally published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> in 1996 for the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. The fourth platforming-focused game in the Kirby series, Super Star is actually a collection of seven main game modes and two smaller <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigames</a>. All of the modes star eponymous protagonist <a href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\">Kirby</a>, a pink puffball who can inhale his enemies and swallow them to copy their special abilities. New to the franchise is the ability for Kirby to convert his current Ability into a \"Helper\" AI partner which can optionally be controlled by a second player.</p><p>Super Star was remade for the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> in 2008 as <a href=\"/kirby-super-star-ultra/3030-21084/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21084\">Kirby Super Star Ultra</a>, featuring enhanced graphics and sound effects, rearranged music, 3D cutscenes, four new main game modes and three new minigames. The original title was digitally re-released for the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> and the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> via <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>, and it also appears in the <a href=\"/kirbys-dream-collection-special-edition/3030-38070/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38070\">Kirby Dream Collection</a> disc-based compilation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>As with previous Kirby titles, most of the game modes in Super Star consist of platforming through a series of levels that gradually increase in difficulty, nearly all of which contain several standard enemies and a stage <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss</a>. Kirby's basic move set allows players to walk, run, jump and fly, and Super Star introduces two new core abilities: the <a href=\"/slide-tackle/3015-1849/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1849\">slide tackle</a> and <a href=\"/blocking/3015-1843/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">guarding</a> to reduce damage. Besides his new slide tackle, Kirby can also inhale enemies or objects before spitting them out as his standard method of attack. However, some enemies can be swallowed to grant Kirby a special <a href=\"/copy-ability/3015-7094/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7094\">Copy ability</a> based on the type of enemy consumed.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/276248-superstar3.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276248\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/276248-superstar3.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276248\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/276248-superstar3.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5891/276248-superstar3.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>Although the Copy mechanic was originally introduced in <a href=\"/kirbys-adventure/3030-15890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15890\">Kirby's Adventure</a>, Super Star features a new set of twenty-four Copy powers for players to discover throughout the game, some of which make a return from Adventure. This is the first Kirby game that displays full <a href=\"/in-game-moves-list/3015-2970/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2970\">in-game move lists</a> for each of Kirby's Copy abilities, and the first to have unique hats associated with each power-up. Kirby can sacrifice his equipped Copy ability at any time in order to summon a <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">CPU</a>-controlled helper character corresponding to that ability. Helpers have many of the same abilities as Kirby and occasionally possess special techniques, and they all employ a unique color scheme to differentiate the helper from its enemy counterpart. A second player can play as the helper character by connecting a second controller.</p><p><ins><strong>Ability &amp; Helper List</strong></ins></p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th

data-ref-id=\"3055-2363\">bulletin board</a>-style menu, although only four of the main modes (<em>Spring Breeze</em>, <em>Dyna Blade</em>, <em>Gourmet Race</em> and <em>The Great Cave Offensive</em>) and both minigames are initially available. <em>Revenge of Meta Knight</em> is unlocked by finishing <em>Spring Breeze</em> and <em>Dyna Blade</em>, as well as placing first in <em>Gourmet Race</em>. <em>Milky Way Wishes</em> requires completion of all four of these modes, and <em>The Arena</em> is only accessible after clearing <em>Milky Way Wishes</em>. While each game mode only allows for a single save file, three separate player profiles can be accessed from Super Star's main title screen that track players' overall progress across each of the sub-games. Earning 100% completion on a single profile unlocks the game's <a href=\"/sound-test/3015-634/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-634\">Sound Test</a>.</p><h3>Spring Breeze</h3><p>King Dedede and his minions have stolen all of the food in Dream Land, and it's up to Kirby to recover it before the inhabitants starve. The easiest and shortest of the seven main game modes, <em>Spring Breeze</em> is essentially a remake of the original <a href=\"/kirbys-dream-land/3030-19788/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19788\">Kirby's Dream Land</a> with four stages and the inclusion of Copy abilities, which were not present in the original game, as well as altered stage layouts. However, <em>Spring Breeze</em> omits the \"Castle Lololo\" stage and <a href=\"/kabula/3005-23502/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23502\">Kabula</a> boss from Kirby's Dream Land. It also removes the <a href=\"/boss-rush/3015-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1465\">boss rush</a> mini-stages that originally occurred prior to fighting the game's final boss, <a href=\"/king-dedede/3005-1301/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1301\">King Dedede</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 1 - Green Greens</strong>: A short, grassy level that gently introduces players to Kirby and a handful of his Copy abilities.

This game features a simple world map containing four main stages, as well as two hidden stages that serve as power-up caches for several of Kirby's various Copy abilities. Although somewhat lengthier than <em>Spring Breeze</em>, this mode is only slightly more difficult in comparison and continues to introduce new Copy powers to the player, some of which can be used to open new areas or discover secret items.</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 1 - Peanut Plains</strong>: A breezy area that hosts only a few enemies, but the terrain is rugged enough to keep new players on their toes.

There are a total of sixty unique treasures to discover; each one collected increases the player's overall completion rate.

Collecting all of the game's treasure also requires extensive knowledge of Kirby's various Copy abilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Sub-Tree Area</strong>: Kirby falls into an underground forest teeming with enemies.

feature a time limit for each level, as well as NPC commentary during gameplay in the form of dialogue boxes at the bottom of the screen, lending <em>Revenge</em> a more frantic tone than Super Star's previous games. Meta Knight appears near the end for a climactic sword duel and continues to harass Kirby during the final escape sequence from the destroyed Halberd.</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 1 - Halberd Deck</strong>: Kirby begins his assault on the main deck of Meta Knight's warship, but he is distracted by <a href=\"/heavy-lobster/3005-29371/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29371\">Heavy Lobster</a> before being blown away from the ship by one of its main thrusters.</li><li><strong>Stage 2 - Orange Ocean</strong>: After landing in the ocean, Kirby quickly makes his way to shore and finds a Warp Star, but he is shot down by the Halberd's cannon and falls into a forest.

Boss: <a href=\"/bonkers/3005-29364/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29364\">Bonkers</a> (x2)</li><li><strong>Stage 4 - Halberd Cannon</strong>: Dyna Blade is injured by cannon-fire, but Kirby manages to board the Halberd once more and quickly destroys its Main Cannon No. 2.

Boss: <a href=\"/mr-frosty/3005-29358/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29358\">Mr. Frosty</a></li><li><strong>Stage 6 - Halberd Interior</strong>: Jumping into a hull breach, Kirby fights through the Halberd's maintenance ducts and is again ambushed by Heavy Lobster. This time Kirby destroys it and takes out the Halberd's right wing. Boss: <a href=\"/heavy-lobster/3005-29371/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29371\">Heavy Lobster</a></li><li><strong>Stage 7 - Halberd Lower Hull</strong>: Clouds swirl beneath the belly of the Halberd, giving Kirby some much-needed cover as he infiltrates the underside of the ship and destroys its main reactor. Boss: Halberd's Reactor</li><li><strong>Stage 8 - Halberd Bridge</strong>: Kirby makes his final approach towards the bridge as the crippled Halberd rapidly loses altitude, where Meta Knight awaits him for one last duel.

Kirby navigates between planets on an overworld map, allowing players to visit stages in any order. This mode also features a twist on the standard Copy mechanic in that Kirby can no longer swallow enemies to Copy their powers; instead, players must locate Copy abilities as unique pedestals hidden throughout the game's stages. Once a particular Copy ability has been acquired, Kirby can manually activate that ability at any time without the need to swallow its corresponding enemy first.</p><p>After gathering all of the planets' power and summoning Nova, Marx suddenly reappears and shoves Kirby aside before making his own selfish wish to rule over Popstar. Nova complies and grants Marx incredible power, and Nova then begins to descend upon Popstar. Fortunately the comet is temporarily held back by the combined strength of the Sun and Moon, allowing Kirby to fly into Nova on a <a href=\"/warp-star/3055-406/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-406\">Warp Star</a>. He destroys its mechanical core from the inside, halting Nova's advance long enough for Kirby to confront the powered-up Marx in an all-out final battle. Once defeated, Marx flies out of control toward the heavens and crashes straight into Nova, destroying them both in a massive explosion and ending the crisis on Popstar.</p><ul><li><strong>Floria</strong>: Popstar's closest neighbor, its climate can be altered simply by entering a door, and Kirby can use these seasonal changes to open new paths.

When the game begins, both characters appear on opposite sides of the screen. Players must react to a sudden on-screen \"!\" prompt by pressing any button, with the winner being whoever strikes first without a false start. Against the CPU, Kirby's opponents will gradually react more quickly, with Meta Knight being the fastest CPU opponent. This minigame features three levels of CPU difficulty and a two-player mode.</p><h3>Megaton Punch</h3><p>The second timing-based minigame takes place in a martial arts competition between Kirby and three separate opponents where the goal is to cause the most damage to a stack of bricks in a single strike. Three different meters must be activated in succession to build up striking power, with their strength determined by the player's timing accuracy. The competitor who deals the most damage (measured in megatons) in a single round will be declared the winner. Like <em>Samurai Kirby</em>, <em>Megaton Punch</em> also features three levels of CPU difficulty and a two-player mode.</p>", "deck": "Take control of the the famous pink puffball and his new \"Helper\" friends as they trek through a collection of platforming adventures and minigames.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/292507-kirbysboxart.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/292507-kirbysboxart.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/kirby-super-star/3030-9233/", "name": "Kirby Super Star", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-9233/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-9/", "id": 9, "name": "ESRB: K-A"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-9/", "abbreviation": "SNES", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/", "id": 9, "name": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/", "abbreviation": "WSHP", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/", "id": 87, "name": "Wii Shop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 15:49:33", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 9233, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "Kirby's Fun Pak\r\nHoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe"}, "platform": "SNES", "title": "Kirby Super Star"}, {"duration": "2:31:00", "runner": "Eazinn, V0oid, Nocturne_, Fathlo23, Silent Wolf, Supreme, Kanis999, waffle42, suzuribaco", "data": {"original_release_date": "1994-11-25 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2016-07-27 01:09:46", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/223661-donkey_kong_country__12_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223661\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/223661-donkey_kong_country__12_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223661\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/223661-donkey_kong_country__12_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/223661-donkey_kong_country__12_.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>Donkey Kong Country (known in Japan as<em> Super Donkey Kong</em>) is a 2D platformer developed by <a href=\"/rare-ltd/3010-174/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-174\">Rareware</a> and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> for the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> on November 25, 1994.</p><p>Rare's first game after becoming a subsidiary of Nintendo, Donkey Kong Country is among the first games to fully utilize pre-rendered 3D graphics for its visuals.

They are capable simply of walking, running, performing a rolling attack, and <a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jumping</a>. However, Donkey Kong Country featured a strong level of interaction with the environment, which greatly multiplied the gameplay possibilities in the game: <a href=\"/rope/3055-633/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-633\">ropes</a> could be swung on, bouncy tires could be rolled or jumped on, and a vast array of various <a href=\"/barrel/3055-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-82\">barrels</a> could be picked up, thrown, or busted on enemies' heads. Still other barrels, called barrel cannons or blast barrels, floated in midair and could be leapt into, upon which depending on the type of barrel, either pressing a button or immediately upon entry, the player is blasted out of the end of the barrel. Often times, these barrels moved or rotated along paths, creating timing exercises which must be mastered to progress in the game.</p><p>The primary method for dispatching enemies is to jump on them, or to toss barrels into them. Most enemies may also be put out of commission with a rolling attack as well, but some have defenses in this direction. While both Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong may appear on the screen at the same time, only one is actually controlled by the player; should the active character be injured, the inactive character will become playable. Should there be no inactive player, the player loses a life and must start the level over, either from the beginning or the midway checkpoint. Falling into pits results in instant death.</p><p>There are also animal buddies in the game, which are found in crates and which the active character may ride to gain access to special abilities. These animal buddies and their abilities are listed below in the characters section.</p><p>There are many secret areas in Donkey Kong Country, which may be found by blasting away walls with tough blows from barrels and rhinoceros horns, or jumping in spots above or below the screen to hidden barrels. These secret areas usually contain a chance to earn either extra lives or animal buddy tokens. Collecting three of the same type of animal buddy token will allow the player to play a different sort of bonus level, in which there is a set amount of time to gather as many tokens as the player can while playing as the animal buddy in question. Every 100 tokens collected results in one extra life earned. There are also hidden giant tokens in these levels which, upon collection, will split into many smaller tokens to be collected as well as doubling or even tripling the player's current token score.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>The Kongs</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226743\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226743\"><img alt=\"Donkey Kong\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Donkey Kong\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong</figcaption></figure></td><td>One of the two primary protagonists, Donkey Kong is a large gorilla who is ideal for tackling larger enemies due to his greater mass and strength.

This was a very limited release for certain video game competitions during the 1990s such as the Blockbuster Video World Championship II in 1995.</p><p>This version of the game is quite different from the original as it is only playable for five minutes. Within that time limit, the player must gain as many points as possible. There is no title screen, save files, or world map in the game; the player instantly starts on the first level when the cartridge is inserted into the console. When one level is completed, the next level starts. The following levels that the game goes through is Jungle Hijinx, Reptile Rumble, Ropey Rampage, Coral Capers, <a href=\"/winky-the-frog/3005-11312/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11312\">Winky</a>'s Walkway, Bouncy Bonanza, Orang-Utan Gang, and Snow Barrel Blast. At the end of the 5 minutes, the game freezes at its current state in order to allow time for the referee of the competition to take note of the points.</p><h2>Handheld Ports</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466319\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466319\"><img alt=\"A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png 160w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> port was released on November 4th, 2000. This is essentially the same game, except with some <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-games</a> thrown in. Naturally, the graphics aren't as impressive as the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> version and the game would begin to slow down to a crawl when there were more than a few sprites on screen at once, but was still considered a technological marvel being able to port a SNES game to Game Boy Color, with the core concepts being intact. There are a few other differences in the game, for example, only one character is on-screen at a time. Also, when an animal character is gained, <a href=\"/diddy-kong/3005-304/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-304\">Diddy</a> or <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a> will leave and the player gets to play as the animal as opposed to Diddy or Donkey Kong. The Game Boy Color version's music was mostly ported over from the 8bit soundtrack of <a href=\"/donkey-kong-land/3030-8200/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8200\">Donkey Kong Land</a>, although certain tracks had been switched around, such as DKL's water level music now being used for an ice cavern level.</p><p>The game featured an additional <a href=\"/cave/3035-1727/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1727\">cave</a> level in the Chimp Caverns world, Necky Nutmare. It also featured a scrapbook which the player could fill up by finding extra hidden items in the adventure before printing out the pages, as well as a few minigames: a fishing game with <a href=\"/funky-kong/3005-1647/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1647\">Funky Kong</a>, a barrel- <a href=\"/kremlings/3015-3312/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3312\">Kremling</a> coconut-shooter with <a href=\"/cranky-kong/3005-311/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-311\">Cranky</a>, as well as some small bonus games with <a href=\"/candy-kong/3005-4238/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4238\">Candy Kong</a> since her save room was unnecessary now that the game autosaved after each level was completed.</p><p>Released on June 9th, 2003, Donkey Kong Country on the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> is a very faithful remake of the original. In this game the same various extras of the Game Boy Color version were added, such as the mini-games and scrapbook where the player had to find hidden scrapbook pieces throughout the game to unlock concept art. The player was also allowed to save after every level and was able to see their progress on each individual level as well (if they had found the KONG letters, bonus levels, and scrapbook pieces.) A \"Hero\" mode could also be unlocked by achieving at least a 90% completion rate. This was essentially a hard mode, where the player could only play as Diddy Kong in a yellow color swap suit. There were no D.K. barrels in this mode. The graphics in the Game Boy Advance version are a lot closer to the original than the Game Boy Color adaption, although some of the parralax backgrounds, map details and sprite resolutions have been downgraded, and the weather effects present in some levels from the original were taken out.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

He is back after serving fifteen years in prison for a killing spree. The Mafia family of Liberty City send him down \"south\" to Miami as opposed to Liberty City, to avoid bringing unwanted attention that could be brought by Tommy's return. They set up a drug deal in Vice City in which Tommy is supposed to participate in the Mafia's hopes to gain a strong foothold down south. The deal goes sour, Tommy's comrades are killed, and he is left in a new city without any money, with little to turn to and a big debt the pay off. [Unlike GTA III's mute protagonist, Tommy Vercetti has <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\" href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413/\">dialogues</a>, which really do well to create his unique persona.]</p><p>Despite the failure of the deal, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4571\" href=\"/sonny-forelli/3005-4571/\">Sonny Forelli</a> decides to give Tommy a chance to get the drugs and the money back.

He decides to turn to Ken Rosenburg, who escaped the ambush at the deal with him, to decide their next move.</p><p>Ken informs Tommy about a big party going down on the yacht of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4574\" href=\"/colonel-juan-garcia-cortez/3005-4574/\">Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez</a>. Using Ken's invitation, he attends the party and is introduced (although not in person) to several of Vice City's most important people. A loud mouthed <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1593\" href=\"/ricardo-diaz/3005-1593/\">Ricardo Diaz</a> arrives, and Tommy takes the Colonel's daughter to the strip club at her request.

After a confrontational meeting, Kent tells Tommy about a chef who might be involved. Tommy kills the chef after an unproductive interrogation. In the process he meets <a data-ref-id=\"3005-196\" href=\"/lance-vance/3005-196/\">Lance Vance</a>, who gives him a handgun and shows him the local Ammu-Nation store.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367871\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.5875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367871\"><img alt=\"Take that innocent VCR!\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Take that innocent VCR!</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact that he's met some people, Tommy still hasn't found what he's looking for. For the next few days, Tommy performs jobs for Cortez and even Diaz as well as others. One mission involves him and Lance Vance overseeing a deal between Diaz and a group of Haitians. The Haitians turn on Diaz, but Tommy and Lance open fire. Diaz barely escapes with his life. Following the deal, Diaz asks Tommy to meet his friend Quentin. Apparently someone has been selling real estate on his watch, and he is pissed off about that. In reality, Quentin is actually Lance Vance. Diaz killed Lance's brother and he is convinced that Tommy is next. Together they do the job asked of them, but now Tommy knows to keep a close eye on Diaz</p><p>Diaz has clearly lost his mind (although that assumes he even had a sane mind to begin with). Tommy witnesses him shooting his VCR after it fails to operate correctly and firing at birds that make the mistake of landing on his car. Diaz's next mission for Tommy is to steal a boat that apparently is faster than his. Nobody can have a faster boat than Diaz, so Tommy takes it and drives it over to the mansion. However, Tommy learns about someone that moors their boat off the coast and sells their stuff to the first person that gets to them. Using the fast boat he just stole, Tommy as well as Lance beat everyone else to the freelancer. Eventually the two collect enough information to prove that Diaz is the one responsible for the deal at the beginning of the game going wrong.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224205\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224205\"><img alt=\"It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 1280w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, Lance, who's eager to get revenge for the killing of his brother, attempts to take out Diaz himself. He fails miserably and is taken hostage in a junkyard. Tommy rolls in guns blazing and manages to free Lance from the clutches of Diaz's henchman. At this point, Tommy realizes it's now or never; they need to remove Diaz from Vice City. Tommy arrives at Diaz's mansion with Lance. Lance apparently has been stockpiling guns for quite some time; he opens the trunk of his car and the two grab assault rifles. A massive assault begins on the mansion and after a ferocious gunfight Diaz is executed in his own home. Tommy assumes control of the mansion and he, along with Avery Carrington (who gave him missions earlier), Lance Vance, and Ken Roseburg establish the Vercetti gang. Tommy at this point is allowed to start buying real estate throughout Vice City, which in turn generates revenue for him to collect. It may seem like Tommy is on top of the world, but he still has $3,000,000 to collect and pay to Sonny Forelli.</p><p>After a few more missions, one of which involved stealing cop uniforms and blowing up a section of the mall, Sonny decides that he isn't going to wait any longer. He sends someones down to Vice City to collect the money. Tommy creates $3,000,000 in counterfeit cash, but not before killing the man Sonny sent down for the money. Sonny arrives at the mansion, and Tommy hands over the fake money. Then, the unthinkable happens. Lance Vance, who is wildly upset that he isn't getting his fair share of Tommy's money, informs Sonny that the cash is fake. A raid begins on Tommy's mansion, but Tommy manages to kill Lance, Sonny, and all of Sonny's men. Now, with his boss and the maniac he once considered a friend out of the picture, Tommy returns to controlling Vice City.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363493\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.7515625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363493\"><img alt=\"The flamethrower in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The flamethrower in action\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 640w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The flamethrower in action</figcaption></figure><p>The core gameplay design and interface in Vice City remains roughly the same as in GTAIII, other than few interesting twists and added extras. This is very much a Grand Theft Auto title, which means players can steal or \"jack\" vehicles, kill pedestrians, cause mayhem, escape from the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-489\" href=\"/police-chase/3015-489/\">cops</a>, you get the idea. Most of the story progresses through \"missions\" or \"jobs\" which will be given out to Tommy by his various employers at various stages. Later in the game you will have to purchase real estate to have access to some of the missions. Much of the mission design remains same and many of the missions involve eliminating targets either on foot or in vehicle, completing a certain deal, or driving over contacts to a fixed location and so on. However, many of Vice City's missions are truly unique and their novelty adds to the fun of playing the game. Addition of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-366\" href=\"/motorcycle/3055-366/\">motorcycles</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\">helicopters</a> in Vice City is a welcome change.</p><p>The ability to buy businesses like a night club, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1139\" href=\"/taxi-cab/3055-1139/\">taxi company</a>, film studio, printing press, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2080\" href=\"/strippers/3015-2080/\">strip club</a> or car showroom is another addition to Vice City, this is the main generator of income in the game. These businesses once bought unlock a couple of side-missions which need to be completed in order for the businesses to generate revenue. Players could also participate in illegal street races and earn money. As usual there are rampages, stunts and hidden packages - a tradition in GTA games by now.</p><p>Vice City also features some vehicles that weren't seen in Grand Theft Auto III, such as helicopters and motorcyles. There is also a flyable plane that is remarkably easier to pilot compared to the Dodo from GTA III.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3>Emotion 98.3</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609306\" data-size=\"large\" style=\"width: 159px\" data-ratio=\"0.48427672955975\" data-width=\"159\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609306\"><img alt=\"Emotion 98.3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" data-width=\"159\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png 159w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emotion 98.3\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png 159w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" data-width=\"159\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emotion 98.3</figcaption></figure><p><b>DJ:</b> Fernando Martinez</p><p><b>Genre:</b> Power ballads, Rock</p><p><b>Tracklist:</b></p><ul><li>Foreigner -

The game is being developed by the <a href=\"/nintendo-ead/3010-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-463\">Nintendo EAD</a> team responsible for the <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\">Super Mario Galaxy</a> series. At the GDC presentation, a \"Super Mario\" logo was displayed with a silhouette of a tail similar to that of a raccoon's, this hinted at the return of the Raccoon Suit power-up from <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>.</p><p>In addition to that there is something that resembles a <a href=\"/star-coin/3055-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3137\">Star Coin</a> found in the New Mario Bros games or Comet Medal from the Galaxy games in one of the screenshots.</p><p>Iwata also told the audience how they're working on how to solve design problems like how to help players hit the <a href=\"/mario-block/3055-702/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-702\">question blocks</a> even in if it is in 3D and not 2D while showing this game.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><ul><li><b>Tanooki Suit:</b> A returning favorite from <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, the Tanooki suit allows Mario the ability to attack enemies by swinging his tail. It also grants the player the ability to float down by repeatedly pressing the jump button. The ability to turn into a statue is only available once the player has unlocked the special levels.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Golden Tanooki Suit:</b> Does everything that the regular Tanooki Suit can do with added bonus of making Mario completely impervious to all enemies and their attacks with the lone exception of falling of a platform to his death. Its effect lasts until Mario makes it through the level. Only appears after you've died a certain amount of times in certain levels.</li><li><b>Full Tanooki Suit:</b> Only appears in the secret worlds upon completion of the main game. This iteration of the Tanooki Suit replicates the \"true\" Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3. In addition to floating, Mario can transform into a statue in order to protect himself from enemy attacks. The statue form can be activated by performing a ground pound, which also allows Mario to stomp on spiked enemies. The full Tanooki Suit power up appears as a silver leaf, and the suit sports a red (or Green if playing as Luigi) neckerchief.</li><li><b>Super Mushroom:</b> The original Super Mario power up. This makes Mario slightly bigger and protects him from instant death if it by an enemy or any of the hazards found in a level. Mario starts of in his big state by default and thus the Mushroom will only appear if Mario has taken a hit.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Boomerang Suit:</b> Similar to the Hammer Brother suit featured in Super Mario Bros. 3. This suit grants Mario the boomerang throwing abilities of the Boomerang Brother enemies in the game. Boomerangs can be used to grab far away coins and Star Coins</li></ul><ul><li><b>Starman:</b> A Mario classic. Starman makes Mario completely invincible to everything except falling to his death for a brief period of time.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Fire Flower:</b> A Super Mario staple. The Fire Flower grants Mario the ability to use fire balls to defeat enemies.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Propeller Block:</b> Functions similarly to the Propeller Suit in New Super Mario Bros.. When Mario grabs a hold of the block, he will be able to do a second jump in the air and use the block to float around for a short period of time.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Coin Block Mario:</b> Transforms Mario into a coin block.

Can be used in conjunction with whatever suit Mario is wearing when he picks up the coin block power up.</li></ul><h2>StreetPass Functionality</h2><ul><li><b>Question Mark Levels:</b> Most worlds feature a level which is shown on the top screen as a purple cube with question marks on each side. These levels contain <a href=\"/star-coin/3055-3137/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3137\">star coins</a> which can only be collected once. <a href=\"/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\">StreetPass</a> allows for these levels to be replaced with different levels which will contain new star coins and may be more challenging.</li><li><b><a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a>'s House:</b> Many worlds will have Toad's house as a level. These levels feature free power ups which will be replaced with more powerful ones by StreetPass. Each time you connect with a person, the power up linked to them will be more powerful. For example: on the first StreetPass with Person 1, a house will contain a Super Mushroom, on the second StreetPass with that same person, it may contain a Fire-Flower.</li><li><b><a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">Leaderboards</a>:</b> After the special worlds are unlocked, leaderboards become available for each level.

It is the first original <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda </a>handheld title since the Oracle series in 2001. The Minish Cap is the last purely two-dimensional Zelda game with gameplay hearkening back to the original games. After Minish Cap, the handheld games moved to the third dimension with alternative play styles in both <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass/3030-3666/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3666\">Phantom Hourglass </a>and <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks/3030-25657/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25657\">Spirit Tracks </a>for the Nintendo DS. It may well be the last Zelda game of the original formula. Nintendo have since confirmed that the game takes place second in the Zelda timeline (after <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/3030-26934/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26934\">Skyward Sword</a>). The backstory it gives is similar to that of <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">Ocarina of Time</a>, and it introduces how Link got his iconic green cap.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 565px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262646\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66548672566372\" data-width=\"565\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262646\"><img alt=\" Link, shrunk down to Picori size.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg 565w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2901/262646-tn_565_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Link, shrunk down to Picori size.</figcaption></figure><p>The Minish Cap has many similarities with previous <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda </a>titles. It retains the same style of dungeon exploration, item collection, and boss beatdowns. It only allows players to have two items at once, and Link's sword does not have to be equipped at all times, which allows for more creative puzzle solving. Each boss is defeated by an item that Link gains in the boss' dungeon. As with previous titles, the Minish Cap features numerous side-quests that allow Link to gain a variety of different power-ups such as weapon upgrades and another series regular, Piece of Heart. There are many recurring characters and races in the game as well, such as <a href=\"/goron/3015-857/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-857\">Gorons </a>and <a href=\"/tingle/3005-880/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-880\">Tingle - </a>whom has many brothers this time around. Enemies from the previous games return as well, including Octoroks, ChuChus, and Keese. Some of the classic items in the Zelda series are also featured in the Minish Cap, including the Boomerang, Bow, and the Pegasus Boots. The Minish Cap also introduces plenty of new weapons as well. Some new toys in <a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a>'s arsenal include the Gust Jar (which shoots a gust of wind), Roc's Cape (likely a descendant of Roc's Feather; it allows Link to float), and the Mole Mitts (which allow Link to dig). The most important new tool is Link's cap, the Minish Cap. The Minish cap, a living hat named <a href=\"/ezlo/3005-8701/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8701\">Ezlo</a>, not only acts as a guide to Link (similar to <a href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\">Navi</a>) but also allows him to shrink down to explore new areas.</p><p>For the first time in any handheld Zelda game, Link is able to roll. This can be used both for mobility and combat. Link also gains abilities from previous games like Wind Waker (Great Spin Attack) and Adventure of Link (Down Thrust).</p><h3>Kinstones</h3><figure style=\"width: 240px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872485\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872485\"><img alt=\"This NPC wants to fuse Kinstones.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"This NPC wants to fuse Kinstones.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872485-zeldamini5.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This NPC wants to fuse Kinstones.</figcaption></figure><p>The game introduced new features as well, one of them being the Kinstones system. As Link traverses about the world, he can find various Kinstone Pieces. These are used to piece together with NPCs. After fusing Kinstones with an NPC, an event will happen somewhere in the overworld and the player can travel there for an item or power-up of some sort. Kinstone Pieces are colored by rarity, the rarest offering the best reward. There are four colors of Kinstone: blue, brown, green and gold. The Gold ones are the rarest and are only used for Story progression. NPCs that want to fuse appear randomly, although they have the same piece requirement no matter how many times the player plays through the game. Keeping track of which characters Link has fused with and have fused with is a challenge that leaves most games unfinished.</p><h3>Figurines</h3><figure style=\"width: 290px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66896551724138\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872496\"><img alt=\"One of many figurines.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of many figurines.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872496-item1.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of many figurines.</figcaption></figure><p>Another feature unique to the Minish Cap is the figurine sidequest. Throughout the world Link can collect Mysterious Shells which are then used in a lottery type game to earn figurines. Figurines can be of enemies, characters, or locations that Link has encountered in his travels. However, figurines are only available after Link has met the character, killed the enemy, or gone to the location. The chance of winning a figurine that hasn't been won before is upped by the amount of Mysterious Shells that are spent in the machine, one shell upping the percentage by one.</p><h2>Items and Weapons</h2><h3>Sword and Four Sword</h3><p>The main weapon of choice for Link in this adventure. It is used to attack various enemies, bushes and pots that stand in Link's way. When in its final form, the Four Sword, it allows Link to use special blocks located around the world to solve various puzzles by creating up to three clones of himself that involve defeating various enemies and pushing heavy blocks/boulders that may block his path. Link can also learn various techniques through eight Tiger Scrolls that give him a wide variety of attacks throughout the game.</p><h3>Gust Jar</h3><figure style=\"width: 850px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316370\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74117647058824\" data-width=\"850\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316370\"><img alt=\" Link with the Gust Jar.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 850w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Link with the Gust Jar.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 850w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316370-zmc_link_exploding_pot.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Link with the Gust Jar.</figcaption></figure><p>This item allows Link to clean up patches of dirt by sucking up air from a reasonable distance away. Doing so will allow Link to go over areas once that hindered his progress without any problems. If Link continuously holds the jar out, the jar will change color and allow him to fire a gust of wind out to attack enemies in the area. In the first dungeon of the game, it is mainly used to cross over water by bringing mushrooms towards him that flung him over water.</p><h3>Cane of Pacci</h3><p>This cane is used to flip over various blocks and enemies throughout the game. When used on certain enemies, they become vulnerable to Link's attacks. When used on objects, they allow Link to progress over them that will allow him to visit new areas. This item is picked up in the second dungeon of the game and it can be used from a small distance. If it is shot at a hole in the ground, Link will be able to jump on to higher ledges.</p><h3>Boomerang and Magical Boomerang</h3><p>The Boomerang is Link's standard throw and comeback weapon in this game. It can stun enemies as well as get small item pickups such as hearts, rupees, arrows and bombs that are across gaps. It can only be fired in a single direction, unlike the Magical Boomerang, which can be controlled by holding the item button and moving the direction pad. While it doesn't give the player complete control over its movement, they can bend it around certain obstacles.</p><h3>Small Shield and Mirror's Shield</h3><p>The Shield allows Link to block physical, but not magical projectiles from enemies. It's gotten very early on in the game before Link visits any dungeons and is very useful when Link is low on health. It can also be used to getting around some of the trickier, but smaller enemies, and can sometimes stun them if it is a certain type of enemy. The Mirror Shield allows Link to block energy attacks from enemies, and it can also not be taken away by Like-Likes, unlike the small shield, as it is a unique item received via a side quest.</p><h3>Mole Mitts</h3><figure style=\"width: 900px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316371\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316371\"><img alt=\" Link digging with the Mole Mitts\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 900w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Link digging with the Mole Mitts\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 900w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316371-zmc_link_mole_mitts.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Link digging with the Mole Mitts</figcaption></figure><p>This item allows Link to dig through dirt. While it's only used in a few places in the entire game, it is useful since it allows him to open up new paths.</p><p> </p><h3>Flame Lantern</h3><p>Using this item allows Link to light up a certain area around Link in darkened places. It can also be used to light torches in various areas to provide a greater viewing area in those places, as well as solve certain puzzles to open up access to new rooms or give him treasure in the form of new items, money, etc.</p><h3>Bombs and Remote Bombs</h3><p>By using bombs, Link can both damage enemies and break through certain walls. However, bombs can also harm Link; to avoid taking damage, Link must move away from the bomb's blast radius.</p><p>Once Link plants a bomb, they can be picked up and thrown. Regular bombs have a small time limit before they explode; remote bombs (which can be obtained later in the game) allow Link to control exactly when his bombs explode.</p><h3>Pegasus Boots</h3><p>The Pegasus Boots allow Link to run fast with his Sword held out in front of him. They are mainly used to have Link get through timed gates, but are also useful for quick travel around Hyrule.</p><h3>Roc's Cape</h3><p>Unlike Roc's Feather in previous Game Boy Zelda games, this allows Link to double jump and float by holding on the item button. This also allows Link to climb vertically in the dungeon it is picked up in. It is also used to cross various gaps and avoid enemies quickly.</p><h3>Ocarina of Wind</h3><p>This Ocarina acts similarly to the one in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/3030-10276/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10276\">A Link to the Past</a>, by allowing Link to quick travel to one of a few preset locations throughout Hyrule by using it. A bird called Zeffa will fly Link to a destination of his choice. But he must first, in a similar to fashion to the game mentioned above, free the bird from its statue.</p><h3>Bow, Arrows, and Light Arrows</h3><p>This combination of items allows Link to fire projectiles at enemies directly in front of Link. They also allow him to hit switches that are otherwise unreachable, via Gust Jar or Roc's Cape. Near the end of the game Link receives the Light Arrows, a superior form of Arrows that allow him to charge them up and fire an arrow at enemies with both physical and magical properties. These arrows are mainly used to defeat the final boss of the game.</p><h3>Bottles</h3><p>These allow Link to carry certain items for healing throughout the game. Link can obtain four of these throughout the game, and will allow him to carry such items as Lon Lon Milk, a substance that heals Link's hearts, fairies that can also heal him, even after he falls and finally potions with various effects.</p><h3>Grip Ring</h3><p>This allows Link to scale certain vertical walls and mountains.</p><h3>Power Bracelets</h3><p>These bracelets allow Link to push around heavy objects when he shrinks down to Minish size.</p><h3>Flippers</h3><p>These allow Link to swim in water, which allows Link to travel to more places throughout Hyrule and in various dungeons.</p><h3>Pieces of Heart</h3><p>By getting four Pieces of Heart, Link gains a new Heart Container. Link can earn Pieces of Heart by finishing various side quests and opening certain treasure chests throughout the game.</p><h3>Heart Containers</h3><p>These are earned by defeating dungeon bosses throughout the game. While completely optional, they increase Link's overall heart count by 1, while not affecting Link's current Piece of Heart total.</p><h3>Carlov Medal</h3><p>A completely useless Gold Medal in the form of Carlov's face. This item signifies Link has acquired every single Figurine in the entire game.</p><h3>Kinstone Bag</h3><p>This item allows Link to hold and look at his various Kinstone pieces. It will tell the player how many of each Kinstone piece Link has. It will also change its shape depending on how many Kinstones Link has in it at once, even though it can never reach a set maximum amount of Kinstones.</p><h3>Tiger Scrolls</h3><p>There are eight of these Link earn throughout the game, each of which grants him a special ability. While none of these are required for completion, they make progression through the rest of the game easier.</p><ul><li><strong>Spin Attack</strong> - By holding the attack button with the Sword equipped, Link can do a spin attack.</li><li><strong>Sword Beam</strong> - When his hearts are full, Link's Sword shoots out a beam of energy similar to early Zelda games.</li><li><strong>Dash Attack</strong> - When using the Pegasus Boots and Sword together, Link's sword will be extended while dashing.</li><li><strong>Peril Beam</strong> - When Link is down to one Heart left, his Sword shoots out a beam of energy.</li><li><strong>Rock Breaker</strong> - This allows Link to break Pots with his Sword.</li><li><strong>Roll Attack</strong> - After performing a roll, Link can attack immediately afterwards.</li><li><strong>Down Thrust</strong> - In conjunction with Roc's Cape, Link can use his Sword on enemies from above.</li><li><strong>Great Spin Attack</strong> - The same as the Spin Attack, but if the Attack button is mashed, Link's attack will continue for a while.</li></ul><h3>The Four Elements</h3><p>These jewels are awarded to Link after he completes one of the four main dungeons of the game. They signify their progress throughout the game, and allow him to gain new powers with his Sword until he finally has the Four Sword.</p><ul><li><strong>Earth Element</strong> - This is earned by completing the first dungeon in the game.</li><li><strong>Fire Element</strong> - This is earned by completing the second dungeon in the game.</li><li><strong>Water Element</strong> - This is earned by completed the fourth dungeon in the game.</li><li><strong>Wind Element</strong> - This is earned by completing the fifth dungeon in the game.</li></ul><h3>Ezlo</h3><p>Ezlo is Link's cap. He was once a Minish who was transformed into his green, bird-like, fabric prison by the Wizard, Vaati. Ezlo allows Link to become Minish in size at certain spots in the game, and can also have Link change back to normal size as well. Ezlo is also the game's Navi, giving Link hints and clues as to where to go next in his adventure. Most of them are story-driven events, so Link is never constantly reminded of where to go until those events happen or when the player starts up the game from a save. Link can ask for his help by hitting select at any time.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style=\"width: 600px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316469\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316469\"><img alt=\" Vaati\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Vaati\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg 600w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/316469-zmc_vaati.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Vaati</figcaption></figure><p>The story in the Minish Cap focuses around the origin of <a href=\"/vaati/3005-852/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-852\">Vaati </a>and the Four Sword. The <a href=\"/minish-picori/3015-2537/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2537\">Picori </a>(or Minish) are the creatures who gave a young boy his green clothes, sword, and shining golden light years previous to the Minish Cap.</p><p>The story of the present begins when <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Princess Zelda </a>is turned into stone by the evil wizard Vaati. Link is then chosen by the King of Hyrule to seek out the Picori and ask for their help to save Princess Zelda. When Link sets out, he rescues a talking hat by the name of Ezlo, whom he finds can turn him small like the Picori. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Ezlo used to be a renowned sage and craftsman with Vaati as his apprentice. Vaati was overcome by evil desire and stole a magic hat Ezlo made. The hat grants any wish that the wearer has, and Vaati wishes to become a powerful sorcerer. Ezlo, who tried to stop Vaati, was turned into a hat.</p><p>After recovering the Four Sword, Link must fight Vaati in Hyrule Castle, after Vaati transforms it into Dark Hyrule Castle. After the battle, Ezlo is turned back into a Picori. The magic cap that Vaati stole is then given to Princess Zelda. All of the cursed people are cured and the hat disappears. Ezlo then gives Link a green cap similar in appearance to Ezlo's hat form, and then leaves to the Minish world.</p><h2>Dungeons</h2><p>The Minish Cap has a total of six dungeons. Each of them have varying gimmicks, puzzles, enemies, and bosses.</p><h3>Dungeon #1 - Deepwood Shine</h3><p>The first dungeon of the game, as well as the first Minish-based one. This one mainly involves using the Gust Jar to get around, whether it be from going over bodies of water, moving a leaf around, or clearing cobwebs so Link can proceed.</p><h3>Dungeon #2 - Cave of Flames</h3><p>This dungeon involves mine carts, flipping things over and changing directions to open up more paths to Link. The Cane of Pacci, which is obtained here will allow Link get past enemies previously unbeatable.</p><h3>Dungeon #3 - Fortress of Winds</h3><p>This dungeon involves Link obtaining the Mole Mitts and clearing out paths throughout the dungeon. There are some Minish parts leading up to the dungeon, but overall uses a couple of elements from the previous dungeon.</p><h3>Dungeon #4 - Temple of Droplets</h3><p>The second and final dungeon where Link is Minish in size. This dungeon has ice-based puzzles for the most part. Link must get the Flame Lantern here and it is a big part in solving the many mysteries of this dark dungeon.</p><h3>Dungeon #5 - Palace of Winds</h3><p>This is where Link earns the Wind Element and get Roc's Cape. This dungeon in the sky utilizes a lot of elements from previous temples, including the Gust Jar, the Cane of Pacci and Pegasus Boots.</p><h3>Dungeon #6 - Dark Hyrule Castle</h3><p>This is the final dungeon of the game. Almost every item, weapon and puzzle element Link has faced before comes into play in this dungeon until he finally faces off against the final boss of the game.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li>The Ocarina of Wind tune is the same tune as the Warp Whistle from Super Mario Bros. 3.</li><li>In Hyrule Town, there are three maidens Link can do Kinstone Quests for. Link can only complete two of them. This is an homage to the fact that 2 Oracle games came out on the Game Boy Color, where 3 were originally in development, but one of them was canceled.</li><li>Lon Lon Milk makes its second appearance in the series, Ocarina of Time being the first.</li></ul>", "deck": "Link dons a talking hat named Ezlo as he sets out on a quest to save Princess Zelda and defeat the evil wizard, Vaati.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2119736-box_tloztmc.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2119736-box_tloztmc.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap/3030-6145/", "name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-6145/", "number_of_user_reviews": 7, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-15/", "id": 15, "name": "OFLC: G8+"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-4/", "abbreviation": "GBA", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/", "id": 4, "name": "Game Boy Advance"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-138/", "abbreviation": "3DSE", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds-eshop/3045-138/", "id": 138, "name": "Nintendo 3DS eShop"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:56:27", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 6145, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "Zelda no Densetsu: Fushigi no B\u014dshi\r\n\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u3075\u3057\u304e\u306e\u307c\u3046\u3057"}, "platform": "GBA", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap"}, {"duration": "1:35:00", "runner": "Kirbymastah", "data": {"site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem/3030-1520/", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/", "id": 18, "name": "PEGI: 7+"}], "videos": [], "deck": "The seventh game in the Fire Emblem series and a prequel to Fire Emblem: Fuin no Tsurugi, released for the Game Boy Advance.

Emblem</figcaption></figure><p>Fire Emblem (titled Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken in Japan) is the first title in the Fire Emblem franchise to be released outside of Japan, and the second title in the series to be released on the Game Boy Advance. It is the seventh game in the series.</p><p>The game was released in Japan on April 25, 2003, with follow up releases in the United States and Europe on November 3, 2003 and July 16, 2004 respectively.</p><p>The game is a prequel to <a href=\"../../fire-emblem-fuuin-no-tsurugi/61-1121/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire Emblem: Fuin no Tsurugi</a>; its story and events are set twenty years prior to its predecessor. However, the game was designed with its introduction to western audiences in mind, and thus requires no knowledge of Fuin no Tsurugi's storyline to be enjoyed.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>As with the rest of the series, Fire Emblem is a turn-based strategy RPG in which the player's individual units are distinct characters with their own personalities and histories. Each chapter of the game is focused around a specific battle, and to progress, the player must complete the chapter's primary objective, which may be defeating a boss unit, seizing a position on the map, or successfully defending a position for a certain number of turns.</p><p>Normally, as is the case in all Fire Emblem games, if a character runs out of hit points and falls in battle, they are lost for the remainder of the game unless the player chooses to reset and try again. However, Fire Emblem features two separate storylines; the first, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lyn/3005-1592/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1592\">Lyndis's</a> tale, is structured as an extended tutorial for series newcomers. Units that fall in battle during Lyndis's tale are lost for its remainder, but will still be usable in the second storyline. However, units that fall in the second story (Eliwood's or Hector's, depending on the playthrough), are lost forever.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293450\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293450\"><img alt=\"Lyn, heir to the throne of Caelin\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg 1200w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/293450-lyn.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a><figcaption>Lyn, heir to the throne of Caelin</figcaption></figure><p>Fire Emblem is divided into two distinct parts, in both, however, the player adopts the perspective of a tactician who is found by a girl named <a href=\"../../lyn/94-1592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lyndis</a> (Lyn, for short) in the plains of Sacae at the very beginning of the game.</p><h3>Lyn's Tale</h3><p>In Lyn's Tale, the game's first story, the tactician (default name Mark), is found by a girl named Lyn.

Eliwood then heads to Santaruz, where he meets his friend Hector, brother of Marquess Uther of Ostia. Marquess Santaruz\u2019s dying words direct the group to Laus, where it is revealed that Marquess Laus is working with the Black Fang, a group of assassins, and intends to take over the world. With him is a mysterious man named Ephidel. Marquess Laus sends his son Erik to kill Eliwood and Hector. After the capture of Castle Laus, Erik confesses that one year ago, Ephidel came to Laus and persuaded Marquess Darin of Laus to rebel against Ostia. Elbert, although he distrusted Ephidel, also supported this plan; Eliwood does not believe that his father could have done so.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-829614\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-829614\"><img alt=\"Sonia and Nino of the Black Fang\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonia and Nino of the Black Fang\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/829614-fire_emblem37.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonia and Nino of the Black Fang</figcaption></figure><p>A couple of days later, Eliwood is informed that Castle Caelin has fallen to an attack from the remains of Laus's army. Eliwood meets up with Lyn and her allies, and they recapture the castle and rescue Marquess Caelin. The group then meets the Ostian spy Leila, who is working undercover in the Black Fang. She informs them that the Black Fang, responsible for all that has happened, is controlled by Nergal, a mysterious man who wants to start a war in Lycia for unknown reasons. In addition, Ephidel is a \"morph\", a humanoid creature created through magic that serves Nergal. Elbert is being held captive at Valor Island, also known as the \u201cDread Isle.\u201d</p><p>Eliwood and his troops set sail to the island with the help of the pirate captain Fargus. Along the way, they find Ninian in a small boat. She unfortunately has amnesia, and her brother Nils is not with her, which Lyn finds highly suspicious. Eliwood and company reach the island, but along the way, the group discovers Leila's corpse. Jaffar, one of the Black Fang\u2019s Four Fangs, killed her when Ephidel discovered that she was a spy. After Eliwood finds the temple housing the Dragon's Gate, Ephidel captures Ninian, and Eliwood\u2019s group assaults the temple to rescue her. After the battle, Eliwood finds his seriously injured father near the back of the temple. Nergal and Ephidel appear with the captured Ninian. Nergal feeds Elbert\u2019s soul into Ninian, forcing her to summon a Dragon, but as it emerges from the portal, Nils comes in and brings Ninian to her senses. She immediately closes the portal, destroying both Ephidel and the dragon. Nergal attempts to take Ninian and Nils, but when Elbert wounds him, he flees to recover.

Eliwood assists a mysterious Sage in the desert named Pent, who is the Mage General of Etruria.

When they reach Bern, they hear of Prince Zephiel's coming-of-age ceremony, during which Pent and his wife Louise plan to ask Hellene, the Queen of Bern and Louise's close friend, about the location of the Shrine of Seals. As the group gathers more information on the Black Fang, whose headquarters are in Bern, they are attacked by one of the sons of Brendan Reed, the leader of the Black Fang. After subduing him, Eliwood persuades him that they are not his enemy, at which point the brother decides to track Sonia, Brendan Reed's wife and the woman Nergal is using to control the Black Fang. However, Nergal's morph Limstella kills him. The other Reed brother, showing up later and finding his brother dead, blames Eliwood.</p><p>Queen Hellene agrees to provide Eliwood with the location of the Shrine of Seals if he recovers the missing Fire Emblem, necessary for Zephiel's ceremony. Lyn traces the Black Fang to their mountain fortress, where they hear that Jaffar is to carry out a contract to kill Zephiel. Eliwood returns to the Bern Manse and saves Prince Zephiel from a Black Fang assassination, meeting Jaffar and Nino, Sonia\u2019s daughter, along the way. A grateful Hellene then gives them a map to the Shrine of Seals.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/294380-picture_27.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-294380\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71189979123173\" data-width=\"479\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 479px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/294380-picture_27.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-294380\"><img alt=\"Nino is recruited for the journey to come\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/348/294380-picture_27.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/294380-picture_27.png 479w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/348/294380-picture_27.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nino is recruited for the journey to come\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/348/294380-picture_27.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/348/294380-picture_27.png 479w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/348/294380-picture_27.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nino is recruited for the journey to come</figcaption></figure><p>The group stops by at the Black Fang's secondary base, the Water Temple, where Sonia kills Brendan Reed and Limstella absorbs his quintessence for Nergal. Nino and Jaffar confront Sonia about Nino's parentage, and Sonia reveals that Nino is indeed not really her child, but the daughter of a clan of magic users that she and Nergal killed. Eliwood's troops step in to defend Nino and Jaffar, and finally defeat Sonia. Limstella shows up, but does not absorb Sonia's quintessence because she does not have any, as she was a morph; she just leaves Sonia to die of her wounds, alone in the temple, still thinking she is human.</p><p>Eliwood makes it to the Shrine of Seals, where he defeats the remaining Reed brother. Athos teleports in and takes the group into the Shrine to talk to the other remaining legend, the cautious magic user Brammimond. After talking with Athos, Brammimond is persuaded to open the seals on the legendary weapons used to slay the dragons.

As Eliwood leaves, an Ice Dragon attacks him, and Durandal, seemingly activated on its own, slays the Dragon, which is revealed to be Ninian. Nergal returns to gloat, telling Eliwood that Ninian lost most of her memory when she became a Dragon, and that the only thing remaining was her love towards Eliwood. Ninian uses her last quintessence to change back to her human form and dies in Eliwood\u2019s arms. Enraged, Athos attempts to kill Nergal with the spell Forblaze, but fails. Eliwood and Hector leave the legendary weapons in Athos' care.</p><p>Back in Ostia, as Eliwood's group recuperates, Athos tells them about Nergal's past. He and Nergal, once friends, came across the legendary city of Arcadia, where humans and dragons lived in peace. Nergal spent his time there learning the secrets of acquiring quintessence, which slowly distorted his soul. Athos and the residents of Arcadia teamed up to defeat Nergal, but he managed to escape and fled to Bern, taking control of the Black Fang while he was there.

Eliwood arrives at the Dread Isle and defeats Limstella. Nergal then channels quintessence from the most powerful human leaders and creates morph versions of them, sending them out to destroy Eliwood\u2019s group, but they fail. Then Nergal himself appears but is also defeated; with his dying breath, he summons three Fire Dragons. Brammimond appears and uses his remaining power to resurrect Ninian, who kills two and severely wounds the third. Eliwood's group, using the legendary weapons, manages to slay the last Dragon. After the battle, Athos collapses from exhaustion, and on his deathbed, predicts that \"an evil star will rise... over Bern... but once again, Lycia will bring hope to cleanse the darkness.\" This premonition refers to the events of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Fuuin no Tsurugi.</p><p>One year later, Eliwood is crowned Marquess of Pherae in his father's place, and soon Hector is crowned as Marquess of Ostia.</p><p>Fifteen years later, Eliwood and Hector meet each other in Ostia Castle, where Eliwood introduces his son Roy and Hector introduces his daughter Lilina. While the children play, Eliwood and Hector talk about some events in Bern related to Archsage Athos's predictions. In the final scene of the game, Zephiel, King of Bern, is talking with an \"enigmatic man\" (Yahn from Fire Emblem: Fuuin no Tsurugi), telling him that the Dark Dragon is awake.</p><h3>Hector's Tale</h3><p>Hector's Tale is unlocked after completing Eliwood's Tale for the first time.

The most important of them, which had never before been represented in any Fire Emblem game, is the immersion of the player inside the actual storyline of the game.</p><p>For the very first time in the series (In a concept not to be seen again until \"Fire Emblem: Shin Monshou no Nazo - Hikari to Kage no Eiyuu\" in Japan, and \"Fire Emblem: Awakening\" internationally), the player was represented as a character (a tactician who Lyn finds stranded on the Sacae plains) in the story (albeit a relatively non important and most importantly non-playable character) and had the option to customize his name and date of birth, which determined the element assigned to the tactician. In the Japanese version this included customizing the player's blood type. All of these attributes would come together to develop a personal relationship with the characters (though this wasn't as near as deep as the support conversations between the characters themselves).</p><p>Hard mode, a staple in the Fire Emblem series, returns in this game as well. Upon beating the game once, the option to play Eliwood's hard mode or Hector's mode on regular difficulty is unlocked. Upon completing Eliwood's hard mode, Hector's hard mode is unlocked, which provides several obstacles for the player on top of the regular hard mode difficulties. Usually, there are simply more enemies on the field in the hard mode version of the game. However, in Hector's hard mode every enemy on the opposing team has increased stats (such as strength and health) on top of the fact that there are simply more enemies on the field to deal with. These two things combine to make Hector's hard mode quite a challenge, even for a seasoned Fire Emblem player.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017272\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017272\"><img alt=\"Fire Emblem Premium Soundtrack\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fire Emblem Premium Soundtrack\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1017272-post_275972_1153673981.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fire Emblem Premium Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Opening: History Unveiled</li><li>Fire Emblem Theme</li><li>A Hint of Things to Come</li><li>Road of Trials</li><li>Destiny Enlaced by Fear</li><li>Winds Across the Plains</li><li>Precious Things</li><li>Companions</li><li>Friendship and Adventure</li><li>Distant Travels</li><li>Inescapable Fate</li><li>Dragon's Gate II</li><li>Winning Road</li><li>Binding Ties</li><li>Scars of the Scouring</li><li>Raise Your Spirits</li><li>Shadow Approaches</li><li>Enemies Appear</li><li>The Messenger</li><li>Darkness Comes</li><li>Dragon's Gate I</li><li>Nabata's Wandering Messenger</li><li>Legendary Inheritance</li><li>Raid!</li><li>Messenger from the Darkness</li><li>Strike</li><li>Safeguard</li><li>Victory Now</li><li>Rise to the Challenge</li><li>Softly with Grace</li><li>Everything into the Dark</li><li>Campaign of Fire</li><li>Blessing of the 8 Generals I</li><li>Healing</li><li>Curing</li><li>Receive the Blessings of Water</li><li>Ride the Wind</li><li>To the Heights</li><li>An Unexpected Caller</li><li>When the Rush Comes</li><li>Land of Swirling Sands</li><li>Ships and Homes</li><li>Silent Ground</li><li>The Inn</li><li>Going My Way</li><li>Together We Ride</li><li>A Knight's Oath</li><li>Happiness Abounds</li><li>Merlinus</li><li>Final Farewell</li><li>Requiem</li><li>Recollection of a Petal</li><li>The Cogs of Fate</li><li>The Eight Generals</li><li>The Archsage Athos</li><li>Distant Utopia</li><li>What Comes From Darkness</li><li>Black Fang</li><li>Calamity Bringer: Nergal's Theme</li><li>Nergal's Wrath</li><li>Stratagem</li><li>The Kingdom of Bern</li><li>Bern: A Mother's Wish</li><li>Shocking Truth I</li><li>Shocking Truth II</li><li>Triumph</li><li>Into the Shadow of Triumph</li><li>Main Theme Arrangment</li><li>Blessing of the 8 Generals II</li><li>Girl of the Plains: Lyn's Theme</li><li>Lyn's Desire</li><li>Light to Tommorow</li><li>One Heart: Eliwood's Theme</li><li>Eyes of Sorrow</li><li>Unshakable Faith</li><li>Loyalty: Hector's Theme</li><li>The Grieving Heart</li><li>Reminiscence</li><li>Shattered Life</li><li>Anguish</li><li>Respite in Battle</li><li>Prepare to Charge</li><li>Armory</li><li>Shop</li><li>Fortune Telling</li><li>Arena Entrance</li><li>Arena Battle</li><li>Arena Victory</li><li>Arena Tactics</li><li>Within Sadness</li><li>Game Over</li><li>Legend of Athos</li><li>Results</li><li>Treasured Hope</li><li>Beneath a New Light</li><li>The Path to Greatness</li><li>In the Name of Bern</li><li>Avoided Fate</li><li>Legend of the Dragon God</li><li>Royal Palace of Silezha</li></ol><h2>Classes</h2><table><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Class</th><th scope=\"col\">Description</th><th scope=\"col\">Promotion</th><th scope=\"col\">Description</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Lord</strong></td><td>The main protagonists, which includes the sword wielding princess Lyndis, the axe wielding noble Hector, and the sword wielding prince Eliwood.

The game follows the <a href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-10\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> template, allowing players to combine grabs, flips and grinds and link them together with manuals. The courses are built to resemble areas from the corresponding movies, with the exception of the hub world Olleywood which is closer to a regular real-life skating park.</p><p>The game was released on the GBA, Gamecube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.</p><h2>Gameplay </h2><p>Using the same engine as <a href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4/3030-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2101\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a>, Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure utilized a free roam system. Goals were scattered throughout the various maps and could be attempted upon approach. A point system was also in place for performing tricks using objects in the environment. Outfits and other unlockables could be bought with stars earned by completing goals and challenges.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Three themed worlds came with the game, as well as a zone based on real life metropolitan skate parks called Olleywood. Each world included its own set of playable characters that the player could choose. The player could also create a character with in-games tools. Using these tools, and unlockables, the player could choose to skate with this character in any environment.</p><h3>Toy Story </h3><p>The Toy Story themed environments included Andy's Room and Pizza Planet. The playable characters themed to this world were Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and Emperor Zurg.</p><h3>The Lion King </h3><p>The Lion King themed zone included sections of Pride Rock and the Deep Jungle. Playable characters included Simba, Timon &amp; Pumbaa, Rafiki and Nala.</p><h3>Tarzan </h3><p>The Tarzan themed environments included the Base Camp and the Canopy. Playable characters included Tarzan, Jane, Tantor and Terk.</p><h3>Olleywood </h3><p>Players could also skate in Olleywood, a hub world complete with missions that unlocked items for custom characters. Two children were also default chacters in the world. The two kids were modeled after real-life counterparts that had won a contest.</p>", "deck": "A skating game featuring characters from popular Disney franchises.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1796977-box_desa.png", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1796977-box_desa.png", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1796977-box_desa.png", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1796977-box_desa.png", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1796977-box_desa.png", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1796977-box_desa.png", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1796977-box_desa.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/disneys-extreme-skate-adventure/3030-6759/", "name": "Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-6759/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/", "id": 14, "name": "OFLC: G"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-4/", "abbreviation": "GBA", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/", "id": 4, "name": "Game Boy Advance"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/", "abbreviation": "PS2", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/", "id": 19, "name": "PlayStation 2"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/", "abbreviation": "GCN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/", "id": 23, "name": "GameCube"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-32/", "abbreviation": "XBOX", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox/3045-32/", "id": 32, "name": "Xbox"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:58:44", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 6759, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": null}, "platform": "PS2", "title": "Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure"}, {"duration": "0:15:00", "runner": "Le Hulk", "data": {"original_release_date": "1994-11-30 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2015-11-03 07:36:46", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Released in 1994 for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-29\" href=\"/sega-cd/3045-29/\">Sega CD</a>.

You lose this power by taking damage or using a Launch Star.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355196\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 812px\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355196\"><img alt=\"Cloud Mario\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 812w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cloud Mario\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 812w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cloud Mario</figcaption></figure><p>You become Cloud Mario when you get a Cloud Flower, it gives you three clouds following you.

Nintendo later added Yoshi in this game. He's trapped in a Yoshi egg in some Galaxies, Mario and Luigi can smack it open to free him, then they can ride him.</p><p>He runs faster than the plumbers and are not effected by muddy surfaces that would slow down the player otherwise, his iconic move, the Flutter Jump makes a return, a move that really boost your airtime. Yoshi can also use his long tongue to gobble up fruits and enemies, eating enemies will turn them into Star Bits. Just aim on what you want to eat with the remote and press B, more huge objects requires you to hold B and move Yoshi away from it to drag it loose then eat it. (Example of this is Piranha Plants). You can also use his tongue to grab on floating flowers, which he then can use to swing to the other side.</p><p>If you take a hit while on Yoshi, you're tossed off and Yoshi starts to runs around in panic, you have to jump back on or Spin nearby him to ride him again, left alone for too long and he returns to his egg. Falling into space or getting electrocuted will make Yoshi return to his egg immediately.</p><p>As mentioned before, Yoshi can eat all kind of fruits in this game, and each one has a different effect on him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1657px\" data-ratio=\"0.79118889559445\" data-width=\"1657\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\"><img alt=\"Yoshi's fruit powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 1657w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yoshi's fruit powers\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 1657w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yoshi's fruit powers</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Red Berry</b>: All over the place in most Yoshi stages, you get Star Bits every time you eat one, eat ten to earn yourself a 1UP</li><li><b>Flotacius Blimp Fruit</b>: A blue, ballon like fruit, it turns Yoshi into a ballon which allows him and Mario to float up for a short time, you can hold \"A\" to stop rising, and shake the remote to cancel the move early.</li><li><b>Bulb Berry</b>: Found in dark areas, eating one will make a light zone around Yoshi for a limited time, invisible platforms and objects will become visible and useable if within this light zone.</li><li><b>Red Dash Pepper</b>: Eating one will set Yoshi's mouth on fire for awhile, in this state he can't stop running in great speed, you can still control his direction and jumps though.

Not everyone could fit in the hall at once, so they had to take shifts to watch the orchestra play.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"One of the designers said, \"We'll have to raise the bar for our picture quality much, much higher, so we don't lose out to this music!\", and some members who'd never say they were moved about anything said, \"Well, I was really moved\"</i>. <b>- Mahito Yokota, on the staff's reaction to the music</b></p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1527016\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1527016\"><img alt=\"Takemoto conducts the Super Mario Galaxy orchestra for the staff.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Takemoto conducts the Super Mario Galaxy orchestra for the staff.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1527016-0_1_.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Takemoto conducts the Super Mario Galaxy orchestra for the staff.</figcaption></figure><p>Koji Kondo created five pieces for the game, three of them being <a href=\"/yoshi-star-galaxy/3035-3016/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3016\">Yoshi Star Galaxy</a>, <a href=\"/marios-faceship/3055-3905/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3905\">Starship Mario</a>, and <a href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-825\">Bowser Jr.'s Fortress</a> theme. Starship Mario was written to be an opposite to New Super Mario Bros. Wii's World Map, to be a place for the player to calm down and rest in between levels, which had very active music.

They are capable simply of walking, running, performing a rolling attack, and <a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jumping</a>. However, Donkey Kong Country featured a strong level of interaction with the environment, which greatly multiplied the gameplay possibilities in the game: <a href=\"/rope/3055-633/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-633\">ropes</a> could be swung on, bouncy tires could be rolled or jumped on, and a vast array of various <a href=\"/barrel/3055-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-82\">barrels</a> could be picked up, thrown, or busted on enemies' heads. Still other barrels, called barrel cannons or blast barrels, floated in midair and could be leapt into, upon which depending on the type of barrel, either pressing a button or immediately upon entry, the player is blasted out of the end of the barrel. Often times, these barrels moved or rotated along paths, creating timing exercises which must be mastered to progress in the game.</p><p>The primary method for dispatching enemies is to jump on them, or to toss barrels into them. Most enemies may also be put out of commission with a rolling attack as well, but some have defenses in this direction. While both Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong may appear on the screen at the same time, only one is actually controlled by the player; should the active character be injured, the inactive character will become playable. Should there be no inactive player, the player loses a life and must start the level over, either from the beginning or the midway checkpoint. Falling into pits results in instant death.</p><p>There are also animal buddies in the game, which are found in crates and which the active character may ride to gain access to special abilities. These animal buddies and their abilities are listed below in the characters section.</p><p>There are many secret areas in Donkey Kong Country, which may be found by blasting away walls with tough blows from barrels and rhinoceros horns, or jumping in spots above or below the screen to hidden barrels. These secret areas usually contain a chance to earn either extra lives or animal buddy tokens. Collecting three of the same type of animal buddy token will allow the player to play a different sort of bonus level, in which there is a set amount of time to gather as many tokens as the player can while playing as the animal buddy in question. Every 100 tokens collected results in one extra life earned. There are also hidden giant tokens in these levels which, upon collection, will split into many smaller tokens to be collected as well as doubling or even tripling the player's current token score.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>The Kongs</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226743\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226743\"><img alt=\"Donkey Kong\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Donkey Kong\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/226743-donkey_kong_64.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong</figcaption></figure></td><td>One of the two primary protagonists, Donkey Kong is a large gorilla who is ideal for tackling larger enemies due to his greater mass and strength.

This was a very limited release for certain video game competitions during the 1990s such as the Blockbuster Video World Championship II in 1995.</p><p>This version of the game is quite different from the original as it is only playable for five minutes. Within that time limit, the player must gain as many points as possible. There is no title screen, save files, or world map in the game; the player instantly starts on the first level when the cartridge is inserted into the console. When one level is completed, the next level starts. The following levels that the game goes through is Jungle Hijinx, Reptile Rumble, Ropey Rampage, Coral Capers, <a href=\"/winky-the-frog/3005-11312/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11312\">Winky</a>'s Walkway, Bouncy Bonanza, Orang-Utan Gang, and Snow Barrel Blast. At the end of the 5 minutes, the game freezes at its current state in order to allow time for the referee of the competition to take note of the points.</p><h2>Handheld Ports</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466319\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-466319\"><img alt=\"A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png 160w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/466319-donkey_kong_country_38.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> port was released on November 4th, 2000. This is essentially the same game, except with some <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-games</a> thrown in. Naturally, the graphics aren't as impressive as the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> version and the game would begin to slow down to a crawl when there were more than a few sprites on screen at once, but was still considered a technological marvel being able to port a SNES game to Game Boy Color, with the core concepts being intact. There are a few other differences in the game, for example, only one character is on-screen at a time. Also, when an animal character is gained, <a href=\"/diddy-kong/3005-304/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-304\">Diddy</a> or <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a> will leave and the player gets to play as the animal as opposed to Diddy or Donkey Kong. The Game Boy Color version's music was mostly ported over from the 8bit soundtrack of <a href=\"/donkey-kong-land/3030-8200/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8200\">Donkey Kong Land</a>, although certain tracks had been switched around, such as DKL's water level music now being used for an ice cavern level.</p><p>The game featured an additional <a href=\"/cave/3035-1727/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1727\">cave</a> level in the Chimp Caverns world, Necky Nutmare. It also featured a scrapbook which the player could fill up by finding extra hidden items in the adventure before printing out the pages, as well as a few minigames: a fishing game with <a href=\"/funky-kong/3005-1647/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1647\">Funky Kong</a>, a barrel- <a href=\"/kremlings/3015-3312/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3312\">Kremling</a> coconut-shooter with <a href=\"/cranky-kong/3005-311/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-311\">Cranky</a>, as well as some small bonus games with <a href=\"/candy-kong/3005-4238/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4238\">Candy Kong</a> since her save room was unnecessary now that the game autosaved after each level was completed.</p><p>Released on June 9th, 2003, Donkey Kong Country on the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> is a very faithful remake of the original. In this game the same various extras of the Game Boy Color version were added, such as the mini-games and scrapbook where the player had to find hidden scrapbook pieces throughout the game to unlock concept art. The player was also allowed to save after every level and was able to see their progress on each individual level as well (if they had found the KONG letters, bonus levels, and scrapbook pieces.) A \"Hero\" mode could also be unlocked by achieving at least a 90% completion rate. This was essentially a hard mode, where the player could only play as Diddy Kong in a yellow color swap suit. There were no D.K. barrels in this mode. The graphics in the Game Boy Advance version are a lot closer to the original than the Game Boy Color adaption, although some of the parralax backgrounds, map details and sprite resolutions have been downgraded, and the weather effects present in some levels from the original were taken out.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

The game runs at a native 1080p resolution while maintaining the original game's 30 frames per second. Wind Waker HD also enhances the originals toon-shaded art style with some modern shader technology that introduce bloom lighting, soft real-time shadows and a generally more vibrant feel to it. The black and white section in of the original game is now presented in sepia tone. Textures were upgraded for the higher resolutions as well.</p><h3>Audio</h3><p>All the effects and music have been reworked and mixed with higher quality samples and a much crisper sound while still keeping the feel of the original game's audio intact.</p><h3>User Interface &amp; GamePad Support</h3><p>The game makes use of the Wii U GamePad. The GamePad screen allows for instant access to Link's inventory which the player can manipulate via touch-controlled drag-and-drop. During sea travel, the screen displays the sea chart, letting players plan their course without interrupting the gameplay.</p><p>Similar to the updated Ocarina of Time 3D, the UI now as a dedicated button for the Wind Waker baton, treasure-hook and boat-cannon removing the need for players to equip the associated items in an item slot manually. Also, players no longer have to equip a sail in an item slot as the UI now automatically activates it and associates the A and B-buttons with the sail functions as contextually appropriate. Players also can use the GamePad screen to control the wind waker, swiping in the corresponding desired direction. All of these improvements result in a more streamlined UI that removes a lot of manual back-and-forth between the game and the inventory screen from the original.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496850\" data-ratio=\"0.56234718826406\" data-width=\"818\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 818px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496850\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg 818w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2496850-p1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>On top of that, the button bindings section of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">HUD </a>can be completely disabled to leave only the hearts and rupee/key counter on screen.

Glorious Speed!</figcaption></figure><p>Link is now able to acquire the Swift Sail in the auction house after beating the first dungeon. The Swift Sail speeds up sea travel and lets players directly control the ships movement, removing the need to manually use the Wind Waker to change the direction of the wind.</p><p>This particular feature was initially planned to be incorporated into the original release but was omitted due to the technical limitations of the GameCube console as it was only capable of loading a single block of ocean at a time and the slower sailing speed was required to mask loading times.</p><h3>Improved Triforce Quest</h3><p>Steps are also being taken to improve the general pacing of the game, particularly in regards to the Triforce hunt prior to the final dungeon. Players now have to go out and decipher only three sea charts to find Triforce pieces and the remaining five can be acquired instantly. Additionally, it is no longer possible to accidentally skip Tingle Island as a new introductory sequence has been added to the main quest of the game.</p><p>Further pacing improvements come via shorter animations and faster text-scroll speed.</p><h3>Miiverse</h3><h4>Messages in a Bottle</h4><p>The Tingle Tuner from the original game, which was used to interface with the GameBoy Advance to allow for unique asymmetric gameplay mechanics, is being replaced by Miiverse Integration. Aonuma stated this was decided because the Tingle Tuner was meant to be a \"helper tool\" to aid the player in tricky situations. Miiverse Integration now comes in the form of messages in a bottle that will wash up on shores containing messages from players left on Miiverse, in a Demon's Souls-like fashion.</p><h4>Picto Box</h4><p>Another feature tying into Miiverse is the Picto Box, the in-game camera. Link can now even take photos of himself with a selection of preset facial expressions. The capacity of the Picto Box has also been upped to hold 12 pictures at the same time. All the images taken with the Picto Box can be shared directly via Miiverse.</p><h3>First Person Mode</h3><p>Ever since <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">Ocarina of Time</a>, players had the opportunity to view the world in first-person, but it wasn't until <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/3030-26934/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26934\">Skyward Sword</a> that Link was allowed to move around freely in first-person and be able to use ranged items. This ability has now been added to The Wind Waker HD. However, players are still restricted from using melee equipment such as swords while in the first-person view.</p><h3>Hero Mode</h3><p>Taking a page from skyward Sword, a harder difficulty setting called Hero Mode is now included. Like in Skyward Sword, enemies will deal twice the amount of damage and Link can no longer obtain hearts from actions such as slashing bushes. The only way to regain health is using a fairy or consuming a potion. However, unlike in Skyward Sword, this mode is now available from the start instead of having to be unlocked by finishing the game once. Hero Mode can be toggled on or off at any time.</p><h3>Bigger Wallet</h3><p>The maximum rupee limit at the start of the game has been increased from 200 to 500 rupees.</p><h3>Sidequests / Treasure Charts</h3><p>The HD version features more treasure charts to hunt down and an item originally obtained via sidequest is now found through such a treasure chart.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3><p>Some of the other miscellaneous alterations which were made to the game are as follows:</p><ul><li>Link no longer gets knocked off the King of Red Lions into the sea if he takes damage whilst sailing the ship aside from some minor exceptions such as colliding with explosive barrels.</li><li>Enemies have a shorter invincibility period after being damaged thus making it possible for some sword swings to hit twice.</li><li>When using the ship's cannon, the bomb's trajectory is displayed on screen making aim shots much easier.</li><li>Conducting the Wind Waker no longer begins until a direction is input.</li><li>Items dropped at sea are automatically drawn towards Link.</li><li>Forest Water now lasts for 30 minutes rather than 20.</li><li>The game no longer freezes if players jump attack on top of the chest in the Ghost Ship.</li></ul><h3>No Extra Dungeons</h3><p>During development of the remaster, Zelda producer <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/eiji-aonuma/3040-38943/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38943\">Eiji Aonuma</a> has specifically stated that a trio of dungeons that were cut from the GameCube game prior to release would not be implemented. Part of the reason for this is that some of that cut content was already used in Zelda titles that followed Wind Waker's original release.</p><h2>Limited Edition Ganondorf Figurine Bundle</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543244\" data-ratio=\"1.207299270073\" data-width=\"685\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 685px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543244\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg 685w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg 530w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg 685w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2543244-wup_ganondorf_ps_front_left_2.jpg 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In North America and Europe, Nintendo sold a Limited Edition <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ganon/3005-512/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-512\">Ganondorf </a>figurine along with the game.

In preparing for the development of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-wii-u-working-title/3030-41355/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41355\">first original HD Zelda title</a>, Aonuma's team experimented with porting past entries into HD, and in the process felt that Wind Waker's art style gained new life on the new console tech. The decision was then made to release an updated version of Wind Waker for the Wii U to tide fans over while work continued on the new Wii U Zelda title.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>As of June 30 2016, The Wind Waker HD has sold 1.82 million copies worldwide.</p>", "deck": "A remastered HD upgrade of the acclaimed Nintendo GameCube classic sporting sharper visuals, gameplay tweaks and various new features tailored to the Wii U hardware.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2538562-wwhdcleanbox.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd/3030-41348/", "name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41348/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/", "id": 18, "name": "PEGI: 7+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}], "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "date_added": "2013-01-23 07:35:02", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 41348, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": "TWWHD"}, "platform": "WiiU", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD"}, {"duration": "1:20:00", "runner": "zoast, Ivan, Behemoth87, WildAnaconda69", "data": {"original_release_date": "1994-03-19 00:00:00", "date_last_updated": "2016-04-06 03:00:43", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81818181818182\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093273\"><img alt=\"Title screen featuring the Metroid Hatchling\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg 550w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1093273-super_metroid___title_screen_550x.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Title screen featuring the Metroid Hatchling</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid is an action-adventure game developed by <a href=\"/nintendo-rd1/3010-928/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-928\">Nintendo R&amp;D1</a> and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>.

It is the third game in the <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a> franchise, and the plot picks up where the last game in the series, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a>, left off.</p><p>Like most games of the series, Super Metroid is an 2D action-adventure game with platforming elements. Players take the role of a female bounty hunter known as <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a> as she explores the deadly planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> and collect an arsenal of weapons and gadgets, which will in turn let her progress into areas that were previously inaccessible.</p><p>Super Metroid was one of the largest and most graphically-impressive games for the console at the time of its release. Even today, the game is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.</p><p>Super Metroid is also famous for the unintentional ability to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">\"sequence break\"</a> the game. This means that although there is roughly a set path for Samus to follow, skilled players are capable of reaching ledges or getting past <a href=\"/barrier/3015-1522/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1522\">barriers</a> before they have discovered the power up that is ordinarily required to get there. For example, by mastering a maneuver known as the 'mockball' players can get the super missiles very early in the game, when they enter <a href=\"/brinstar/3035-1572/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1572\">Brinstar</a> for the first time. This curious mechanic has many people struggling to see who can find the fastest path to take to complete the game, making Super Metroid one of the first games surrounded by the <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">'speedrun'</a> phenomenon.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\"><img alt=\"The famous line\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The famous line</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid opens with a short summary of its predecessor, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> on the Nintendo <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>. After she eradicated the Metroids from their homeworld, <a href=\"/sr388/3035-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-374\">SR-388</a>, Samus Aran finds a Metroid hatchling, which believed her to be its mother. Unable to end its life, Samus brings the Metroid larvae to the <a href=\"/ceres-space-colony/3035-2087/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2087\">Ceres Space Colony</a>, so that scientists could study the mysterious power of the Metroids.</p><p>However, just as she leaves, Samus receives a distress signal coming from Ceres. She immediately returns, only to find everyone dead. After a short treck through the Colony Samus encounters her nemesis, <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a>. They have a short battle which ends with Ridley taking the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> into his possession. She then escapes the space colony as it <a href=\"/self-destruct/3015-1008/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1008\">self-destructs</a> and tracks Ridley to a nearby planet, Zebes.</p><p>Upon landing on the planet, Samus arrives in <a href=\"/crateria/3035-1571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1571\">Crateria</a> and shortly after arriving finds the morph ball and missiles power ups. Afterwards she collects the morph ball bombs and, before she can exit the room, she is attacked by a <a href=\"/torizo/3015-4417/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4417\">Torizo</a> which she defeats. She takes these power ups with her into <a href=\"/brinstar/3035-1572/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1572\">Brinstar</a>. While in Brinstar she fights the sub-boss <a href=\"/spore-spawn/3005-3730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3730\">Spore Spawn</a> in order to receive super missiles. After visiting Upper Norfair to obtain the Hi-Jump Boots, Samus travels to <a href=\"/kraids-lair/3035-1577/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1577\">Kraid's Lair</a> in order to obtain the <a href=\"/varia-suit/3055-1032/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1032\">Varia Suit</a>. After defeating <a href=\"/kraid/3005-3010/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3010\">Kraid</a>, Samus receives the Varia Suit allowing her to travel deeper into <a href=\"/norfair/3035-1574/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1574\">Norfair</a>.</p><p>While exploring Norfair Samus finds serveral more power-ups including the Grapple Beam and she defeats the sub-boss <a href=\"/crocomire/3005-4008/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4008\">Crocomire</a>. After exploring Norfair, Samus uses the Grapple Beam to gain access to the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a>. When she arrives the power is off and the place is deserted except for ghosts. Eventually she arrives in a room and the boss <a href=\"/phantoon/3005-3996/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3996\">Phantoon</a> appears. After defeating Phantoon, power returns to the ship allowing Samus to fully explore it. While exploring the ship she finds the Gravity Suit which will allow her to freely travel through water.</p><p>Samus then returns to Brinstar and uses a power bomb to break the glass tube separating Brinstar from <a href=\"/maridia/3035-1575/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1575\">Maridia</a>. With the Gravity Suit equipped Samus is able to explore the flooded Maridia fully. While in Maridia she defeats the sub-boss <a href=\"/botwoon/3005-9297/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9297\">Botwoon</a> and the boss <a href=\"/draygon/3005-3999/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3999\">Draygon</a>. Upon defeating Draygon Samus receives the Space Jump ability which will allow her access into Lower Norfair where <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a> resides.</p><p>Shortly after entering lowering Norfair, Samus enters a battle with a Golden Torizo which is much more powerful than the previous Torizo she battled. After defeating it she receives her final power-up, the Screw Attack. After further traveling through Lower Norfair she eventually reaches Ridley's hideout. After defeating Ridley she enters the next room but finds that the Metroid Hatchling is not there.</p><p>After this she returns to Crateria and enters the room with the four golden statues of the bosses. The gems of the bosses break and the statues collapse granting Samus entrance into the Space Pirates base, <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a>. While traveling through Tourian, Samus reaches an area where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> (now fully grown) comes out of nowhere and attacks an enemy. After killing the enemy it proceeds to attack Samus draining all of here energy tanks and leaving her with just one blip of energy.</p><p>After recovering at a nearby energy machine, Samus eventually confronts <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> who resides in her signature glass tube. Once Samus does enough damage to Mother Brain the tube collapses and Mother Brain reveals her true form. Halfway through the battle Mother Brain begins to drain all of Samus' energy using a beam attack. Before Mother Brain can unleash the killing blow the Metroid Hatchling appears and attacks her. While Mother Brain is stunned from the attacked the Hatchling begins to regenerates Samus' energy. However, Mother Brain recovers from her stunned state and begins to attack the Hatchling while it is in the process of helping Samus. Mother Brain deals a final blow to the Hatchling killing it, but right before it dies it uses the last bit of its strength to give Samus the power of the Phazon Beam which Samus uses to easily finish off Mother Brain.</p><p>After Mother Brain is defeated a <a href=\"/self-destruct-sequence/3015-423/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-423\">self-destruct sequence</a> is activated and Samus has 3 minutes to get out of Tourian and escape planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> before it explodes. While on her way to her ship she stops to save the animals that helped her earlier in the game. Once she reaches her ship she takes off and while she is flying away Zebes is seen exploding in the background.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><p>Samus' suit can be augmented with a number of <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power ups</a> that grant her new powers and abilities. Each element can be configured on or off in the suit equipment menu. There are a great deal of power ups to collect scattered throughout Zebes and each one that is collected, along with map squares discovered, increases the completion percentage which is displayed at the end of the game.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Power Up</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\"><img alt=\"Energy Tank\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Energy Tank\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Energy Tank</figcaption></figure></td><td><a href=\"/energy-tank/3055-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1926\">Energy tanks</a> increase Samus' maximum energy by 100 points.

It is obtained by equipping all five beams at once (usually the <a href=\"/plasma-beam/3055-1024/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">Plasma Beam</a> and <a href=\"/spazer-beam/3055-1051/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1051\">Spazer Beam</a> can not be equipped together). In order to equip all five beams the player must first charge their beam, while the beam is charged they should go into the menu and equip all five beams. When fired, the Murder Beam produces an invisible wall of broken pixels rather than a sprite and the color is random. It is usually used during the Mother Brain fight as it is capable of killing her very quickly. Another interesting note is that the beam can only be fired to the left, if fired to the right the game will crash.</td></tr><tr><td>Space/Time Beam</td><td>The Space/Time Beam is another unofficial beam that can be obtained using a glitch. Instead of equipping all five beams at once, equipping the Spazer Beam, Plasma Beam, and Ice Beam together will produce the Space/Time Beam (Charge Beam can also be equipped though it is optional). The beam causes heavy lag and is registered as morph ball bomb damage when shot at enemies. The beam is best known for its ability to permanently corrupt the game, make strange alterations to the graphics, and produce several glitches such as resetting item pick-ups.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Abilities</b></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Ability</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87222222222222\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\"><img alt=\"Morph Ball\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 360w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Morph Ball\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 360w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Morph Ball</figcaption></figure></td><td>The <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball</a> gives Samus the ability to curl up into a ball in order to roll through small spaces.

Various techniques such as the mock ball have been used to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past large sections of the game and these techniques are vital in speedruns of the game. There are many opportunities to sequence break and many techniques that can be used to travel through the game at a much faster rate (i.e. shinesparking and spike jumping), because of this the game is speedran often and in many different ways. Speedruns can be run for 100% item completion, low% completion, any% completion, or for certain challenge runs such as beating the bosses in reverse order which requires very advanced techniques to complete.</p><p>Tool assisted speed runs are often much faster than there non-tool assisted equivalents. For example, currently the fastest non-tool assisted any% speedrun of the game is 44 minutes 54 seconds real time set on September 27, 2013 by Kottpower. The fastest any% tool assisted time is 38 minutes 41 seconds real time set on October 25, 2009 by Taco &amp; Kriole, nearly 8 minutes faster than the non-tool assisted run. The reason for the big time difference is because in a tool assisted run the runner plays the game one frame at a time and uses save states in order to create the perfect run. The runner also uses techniques that aren't humanly possible without playing the game at extremely slow speeds to save a lot of time. However, because the game is so popular in the speedrunning world, new ways to save time are being discovered which causes world record times to be broken.

Some are exploited in speedruns in order to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past areas of the game. However, only a small number of the glitches are actually used in speedruns and the majority of them are graphical glitches that are not useful to speedrunners. In addition, there are a small number of glitches that can freeze the game or permanently destroy the games SRAM ruining the cart. However, these type of glitches are very rare and almost impossible to perform on accident. Here are some of the more useful glitches used by speedrunners:</p><p>Mockball - The Mockball glitch allows Samus to retain her running speed while in morph ball form. This glitch can be used to get <a href=\"/super-missile/3055-1928/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1928\">super missiles</a> without having to face <a href=\"/spore-spawn/3005-3730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3730\">Spore Spawn</a> which saves a lot of time.</p><p>Quick-charge - The quick-charge glitch allows Samus to charge up her shinespark over a much shorter distance. The glitch is useful in several areas as shinesparking allows the player to quickly dash through rooms, but it most notably allows the player to enter the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a> without collecting the <a href=\"/grapple-beam/3055-1053/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\"><img alt=\"Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 1440w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 1440w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event</figcaption></figure><p>Stand-up glitch - The stand-up glitch allows Samus to \"stand up\" in the <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> fight during the scripted scene where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> attacks Mother Brain, heals Samus while being attacked by Mother Brain, and then gives Samus the Hyper Beam after it is killed by Mother Brain. Usually Samus in incapacitated during this entire scene, but this glitch allows Samus to move around and attack Mother Brain during the scene allowing for a much quicker fight.</p><p>X-Ray Climb - The X-Ray Climb glitch allows Samus to get stuck in walls and travel outside of rooms without using doors. This glitch can be used to enter <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a> without defeating any bosses, and obtaining a 6% completion percentage which is the lowest possible completion percentage.</p><h2>ROM Hacks</h2><p>Super Metroid is also frequently hacked primarily by using a program called SMILE (Super Metroid Integrated Level Editor). This allows fans of the game to change the games layout however they want whether they want to make small changes or completely change the layout. It also allows them to make graphical changes to give the game a fresh new look. These hacks are not commercial products, they are created and shared among fans of the game for free. They are, however, a big part of why the game still has a large player base almost 17 years after its original release. These hacks give players new ways to experience the game by providing different layouts to explore and, in some hacks, new graphics.</p><p>Many ROM hacks have been created by fans with the help of SMILE and there is a popular forum dedicated to Metroid hacks called <a href=\"http://forum.metroidconstruction.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metroid Construction</a>. At Metroid Construction users can share their created hacks with other members, provide feedback on certain hacks, ask hacking questions, and many other things. Here are some examples of notable Super Metroid hacks:</p><h3> </h3><h3>Super Metroid: Redesign</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705513\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2383333333333\" data-width=\"2400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705513\"><img alt=\"Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-width=\"516\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png 2400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/1705513-1.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1705513-1.png 775w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png 516w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png 2400w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/1705513-1.png 960w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1705513-1.png 775w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png 516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-width=\"516\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid: Redesign is a massive ROM Hack created by Drewseph which, as the name would suggest, completely redesigns the game. The layout is all new and more than twice the size of the original. In addition to this, changes have been made to the physics so that Samus falls to the ground quicker after jumping and new items have been added. A new goal has also been added, Samus has to disable 12 <a href=\"/chozo/3015-605/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-605\">Chozo</a> Guardians, which are hidden throughout the game, in order to enter <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a>.</p><p>For the development of Super Metroid: Redesign, Drewseph was the project leader and level designer. Kejardon was the main programmer with additional programming coming from Jathys, Jman2050, and MathOnNapkins.

The game has been in development for around 4 years, Acheron stated in August 2010 that the game was almost complete but he has been very busy and the game would be done when its done.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1682787-47e0d0920ea085f463fab110.l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1682787\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99115044247788\" data-width=\"339\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 339px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1682787-47e0d0920ea085f463fab110.l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1682787\"><img alt=\"Super Metroid \"Sound in Action\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1682787-47e0d0920ea085f463fab110.l.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1682787-47e0d0920ea085f463fab110.l.jpg 339w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1682787-47e0d0920ea085f463fab110.l.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Super Metroid \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Metroid \"Sound in Action\"</figcaption></figure><p>The soundtrack to Super Metroid was composed by <a href=\"/minako-hamano/3040-58875/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-58875\">Minako Hamano</a> and <a href=\"/kenji-yamamoto/3040-20628/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20628\">Kenji Yamamoto</a>.

Undertale employs a unique <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> combat system combining elements of <a href=\"/bullet-hell/3015-321/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-321\">bullet hell</a> shooters with traditional menu-based commands. <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a> will react differently to the player character depending upon their <a href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">moral choices</a> during the course of the game, leading to one of <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">several possible endings</a>.</p><p>Undertale was developed using <a href=\"/gamemaker/3015-2912/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2912\">GameMaker: Studio</a> and was successfully <a href=\"/crowd-funded/3015-8703/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8703\">crowd funded</a> via <a href=\"/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7378\">Kickstarter</a> on June 24, 2013, raising $51,124 from 2,398 backers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players navigate the <a href=\"/deliberately-retro/3015-996/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-996\">retro</a>-stylized <a href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\">2D</a> world of Undertale from a <a href=\"/top-down-perspective/3015-788/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down</a> oblique perspective. Like most RPGs, Undertale's <a href=\"/silent-protagonist/3015-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">silent protagonist</a> will interact with many <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">non-player characters</a> through dialog text boxes over the course of the game. Many areas also feature <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random encounters</a> with monsters. Undertale primarily uses the framework of a traditional <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> RPG combat system to present its encounters. The main battle menu displays four basic commands: \"FIGHT,\" \"ACT,\" \"ITEM\" and \"MERCY\".</p><ul><li><strong>FIGHT</strong>: The player <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">physically attacks</a> a monster with their equipped weapon. After choosing \"FIGHT\" and selecting a target, a slider bar appears on-screen, allowing the player to perform an <a href=\"/active-reload/3015-48/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-48\">active reload</a>-style <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">quick time event</a> to determine the amount of damage dealt. Monsters may also attempt to <a href=\"/dodge/3015-2476/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">dodge</a> the attack. Like the player, monsters die when their <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">HP</a> reaches zero.</li><li><strong>ACT</strong>: The player interacts with a monster in a non-violent fashion. Selecting \"ACT\" and a corresponding target will open a sub-menu with one or more possible actions, which vary depending upon the targeted monster. Undertale features a variety of unusual ACT commands such as \"<a href=\"/animal-petting/3015-7976/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7976\">pet</a>,\" \"encourage\" and \"<a href=\"/comedian/3015-2270/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2270\">tell joke</a>\"; by choosing the correct sequence of actions, the monster's name will turn yellow in battle menus, indicating that the monster is reluctant to continue fighting.</li><li><strong>ITEM</strong>: Opens the player's inventory to select a single item for use during their turn. The player can also equip armor or weapons during battle through this menu. Some items can end certain battles non-violently on their own.</li><li><strong>MERCY</strong>: The player attempts to resolve an encounter peacefully. Choosing \"MERCY\" allows players to either \"Spare\" monsters or attempt to \"<a href=\"/evade/3015-1575/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1575\">Flee</a>\". Monsters can typically be Spared only after the player has ACTed one or more times to make the monster friendlier as indicated by their yellow name. Certain monsters can be Spared immediately without the need to ACT. Other monsters, particularly <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>, may require players to repeatedly Spare them in order to reach a peaceful resolution.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2814882\" data-ratio=\"0.75233644859813\" data-width=\"642\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 642px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2814882\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg 642w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2814882-steam_screenshot.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>The player acts first in nearly all encounters. After the player's turn, any remaining monsters will attack the player simultaneously in a <a href=\"/bullet-hell/3015-321/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-321\">bullet hell</a>-style <a href=\"/micro-games/3015-613/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-613\">micro game</a>. The protagonist's \"SOUL,\" represented by a <a href=\"/heart/3055-142/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">heart</a>, appears inside a white \"bullet box\" near the middle of the screen during the enemy's turn. The SOUL is maneuvered with directional keys, allowing players to dodge enemy attacks and avoid taking damage.</p><p>Enemy attacks are also color-coded by their effect. Most enemies attack using white-colored objects, which damage the player's SOUL upon contact. Green objects will actually <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">heal</a> the player. Additionally, some enemies can only be Spared after the player has touched one or more of their green projectiles. Aqua-colored attacks only deal damage if the player's SOUL is in motion; conversely, orange attacks deal damage if the player's SOUL is stationary.</p><h3>Soul Modes</h3><p>Most of Undertale's <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss fights</a> include special \"soul modes\" that significantly alter the manner in which the player's SOUL behaves while inside the bullet box.</p><ul><li><strong>Red</strong>: The default color. While red, a player's SOUL can freely move anywhere within the borders of the bullet box. This is the only mode in which players may attempt to Flee from an encounter.</li><li><strong>Blue</strong>: The SOUL is affected by gravity and must avoid obstacles by jumping with the Up directional key in a manner similar to an auto-scrolling <a href=\"/platform/3055-1179/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1179\">platformer</a>.</li><li><strong>Green</strong>: The SOUL is immobilized and uses a shield to deflect incoming magic spears. Using the arrow keys, the player positions their shield as each spear approaches from one of the four cardinal directions.</li><li><strong>Purple</strong>: Horizontal lines appear in the bullet box, and the enemy projectiles will follow these lines. The player's SOUL may only move left or right along the lines, but it can switch to a new line with the up or down keys.</li><li><strong>Yellow</strong>: The yellow SOUL is flipped upside-down and can fire bullets from its tip, which can destroy certain incoming enemy projectiles or damage enemy characters directly.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p>Long ago, the world was divided between two races: <a href=\"/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">humans</a> and monsters. Their peaceful coexistence was shattered by a brutal war in which humanity emerged victorious. After the surviving monsters had surrendered, seven powerful human <a href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\">mages</a> created a magical barrier to seal all monsters beneath the surface of the earth forever.</p><p>Many years later, a young child ventures alone to the top of Mount Ebott, a tall mountain surrounded by forests. Mount Ebott is cursed according to local legends, which state that anyone who climbs its peak vanishes without a trace. Heedless of danger, the youth trips and falls straight down a hole leading deep into the earth. After regaining consciousness, they begin to explore the series of hidden caverns known as the Underground.</p>", "deck": "A quirky role-playing game that takes place in a secret subterranean world and gives players the choice to either kill or spare their enemies.", "image": {"icon_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "medium_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "small_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "screen_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg", "super_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2792695-8926799964-capsu.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/undertale/3030-50897/", "name": "Undertale", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-50897/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "expected_release_month": null, "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}], "date_added": "2015-09-15 16:16:44", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 50897, "resource_type": "game", "aliases": null}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Undertale"}]
